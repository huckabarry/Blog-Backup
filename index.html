		<a href="https://m.afterword.blog/2025/07/14/halfway-through-summer.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-07-14 11:02:34 -0700">Jul 14, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We are about halfway through summer, and life has felt like a juggling act, though not necessarily in a bad way. Our routines have been shifting with the kids out of school. My son has been going to a new supplemental childcare provider, which is something different for us. Prior to him entering elementary school, we had the same care provider all year, so to change part-way through the year has been impacting our routine. I‚Äôm usually responsible for drop-offs, which has added some time to my typical morning commute. Thankfully my wife has been working four long days from Tuesday through Friday and taking Mondays off, which gives her extra time at home with the kids. Some Fridays, my mother-in-law helps out.</p>
<p>Today is one of those days when my wife is home with them, and honestly, I love that they get that time together. We are fortunate to have this flexibility, even if sometimes I wish we had even more family time and could spend Mondays with them.</p>
<p>My daughter has been thriving this summer. She is learning so much, not just in school basics but socially too, and even picking up quite a bit of Spanish. It amazes me how quickly young kids absorb language when they are surrounded by it. My son has been going to an in-home daycare with a small group of kids, mostly girls his age. That might actually be a great fit for him. He is such an outgoing and social child, and at his usual school, he had a classmate with a big personality with some behavioral challenges, such as lying, physical confrontations, and creating distractions during the school day. The two of them together could stir up a lot of chaos and they had to be intentionally separated at times. Prior to this boy arriving at the school, we rarely got negative feedback about our son. While we still get lots of positive feedback, this is new for us.</p>
<p>I feel for his classmate, who moved twice in the same school year and came from Southern California. He lives on our block, and I can only imagine the adjustments he is going through. But I admit I was concerned about the influence on my son, not just the usual playground language but things I really do not want him hearing yet. So this summer, I am grateful for the smaller daycare setting where he gets more one on one attention, runs outside, reads his books, and enjoys a calmer environment.</p>
<p>As for me, work has been busy and sometimes overwhelming. There are big projects ahead, but one bright spot has been getting my first real office with a door. It may seem small, but at 44, it feels like a big shift due to my issues with focus. Before this, I was in a shared office space with constant conversation around me. I like my coworkers, but it was hard to focus on tasks that require deep concentration like design work, writing, or even Zoom calls. When I worked mostly at home, it wasn‚Äôt so much an issue. But now that I‚Äôm in the office 3 days per week, it has impacted my work.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about having an office when not everyone at my level has one, but the way our space works, it makes sense for my role. I can already tell it is helping me stay more focused. I also like that I can play music now without impacting my neighbors. For years, I avoided playing music or podcasts at work because I worried about bothering people nearby. Even with headphones, I often pulled them out to engage with whoever came by. Now, I have been enjoying music on a small Bluetooth speaker, and it lifts my mood throughout the day.</p>
<p>On the professional side, I have been working on trusting my instincts more and speaking up when I have something to contribute, even when I do not have all the answers. I used to stay quiet, especially early in my career. I still remember my first planning internship in a small township in Michigan, when making a simple phone call left me feeling rattled. I was so focused on how people would perceive me, whether they were on the other end of the call or sitting near me in the office.</p>
<p>Now, I remind myself that as long as I approach people with kindness and respect, I have something worth offering. I still feel nervous at times, but I am learning to push through it. While I‚Äôll never be a charismatic, confident person, I do recognize that I‚Äôve made a lot of progress. It&rsquo;s helped that I feel like I have a supportive supervisor who has provided quite a bit of mentorship and I&rsquo;ve appreciated their leadership example. Their work philosophy encapsulates the idea that we shouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;let the perfect be the enemy of the good.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve tried to internalize their example that sometimes moving quickly and learning from mistakes can be better than the analysis paralysis that can easily accompany work in my industry.</p>
<p>On the home front, we are looking into some home improvements, primarily to the fa√ßade/siding, but also likely adding some windows, which is pretty exciting. It may not be my dream house, but it&rsquo;s a nice home, if small, and it&rsquo;s a good neighborhood for kids. I like that me and my wife are on the same page and I&rsquo;ve grown to accept that there is no perfect backdrop to a life, despite how much pressure I put on myself sometimes to be a good parent and provider. Scheming a bit about maybe adding a family room off the back someday, but for now, things are working. Just need to tick off some of the smaller items on the project list, with a goal toward making it feel more my own with minor interior changes.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we&rsquo;re planning some getaways. Camping in a couple weeks, and then a trip to Joseph, Oregon later in the summer. Should be a good time.</p>
<p>So here we are, halfway through summer. Feeling grateful for the flexibility we have, for the small changes that make a difference, and for the moments of growth both at home and at work. I know summer will fly by.</p>

			 <p>Hudson&rsquo;s Detroit and its moods.</p>
<p>As the only tall glass curtain building in the middle of a sea of historic beauties, Hudson&rsquo;s in Detroit stands out. The lines feel deliberate and intentional, working with the surrounding structures to heighten the effect. Sure, the Renaissance Center looms off to the side, separate and hulking, looking dark and foreboding. But it always looks like that.</p>
<p>Hudson&rsquo;s is different. Its appearance shifts with the weather. It&rsquo;s a chameleon. When the sky is heavy and gray, it&rsquo;s a moody teenager in the backseat on a road trip with her grandparents, doing her best to blend in. In the midday sun, it becomes a young man in a crisp business suit, climbing the corporate ladder and vying for attention. When golden hour arrives on a clear day, it turns into a glowing presence at a summer wedding, full of light and impossible to ignore.</p>

			 <img src="uploads/2025/90c0a87ae8.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Three young children are playing soccer on a grassy field, with more people in the background. My son is out front."> 
<p>Today was my son‚Äôs last day of kindergarten soccer for the spring season. The weather matched the mood. Cloudy, a little rainy, and just gray enough to make the end of the season feel like a quiet exhale. The kids on his team, much like the parents, seemed more relieved than anything. While they‚Äôve all improved a lot over the past couple of months, it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre one of the less physically developed teams. I don‚Äôt mean that as a criticism. It‚Äôs kindergarten soccer. But some kids are just more physically aware or focused at this age, and it shows.</p>
<p>This was my son‚Äôs second season, and for many of his teammates, it was their first. Watching them play teams that seemed far more confident with the ball could be tough. It‚Äôs not competitive. No one‚Äôs even keeping score officially. But it‚Äôs pretty obvious when the other team scores repeatedly. And while none of us take it too seriously, it‚Äôs still hard to watch your kid walk off the field disappointed week after week.</p>
<p>Along the sidelines, my wife and I had a small disagreement. I wondered if maybe he‚Äôs just not into soccer, and if we‚Äôve been nudging him toward something that isn‚Äôt really his thing. Often he has a hard time focusing on the game. But he also has laser focus when he‚Äôs building LEGO sets or playing with his sister. So it makes me wonder if we should shift gears and try something else. Music, maybe. I‚Äôve been thinking about starting him on piano. He can really get into his mini keyboard sometimes. He also loves his swim lessons, even though he‚Äôs still learning. Or maybe something outdoors and creative. The challenge, as always, is finding that sweet spot between exposure and pressure. Keeping things fun without pushing too hard.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was fun. We made a stop at Home Depot to grab garden starts and some organic soil to top off our raised bed. We downsized last year from two 4x8 beds to one, so we picked up a few medium-sized containers to grow a couple extras. Pumpkins, zucchini, tomatoes, hot peppers. We‚Äôre getting a late start this year, but it still feels good to get everything in the ground. The kids ‚Äúhelped‚Äù plant and dig and then played on the sidewalk together while I did some yard work. Edging, weeding, trimming the front beds where the tulips and daffodils are finishing up. I even moved a rose bush that‚Äôs been bugging me since we moved in nearly a decade ago. It‚Äôs always been a couple feet out of line with the others, and today I finally fixed it.</p>
<p>My watch said 12,000 steps by the end of it, all earned just puttering around outside with the kids while my wife handled dinner prep inside. I cooked a couple racks of ribs she‚Äôd asked for. They turned out fine. Not amazing, but not bad either.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, we‚Äôre heading to a birthday party for my coworker‚Äôs four-year-old son. It‚Äôs at one of those indoor play zones, which is perfect for our kids‚Äô ages. None of us have met each other‚Äôs families before, so it‚Äôll be one of those odd but nice moments when different parts of your life get to overlap.</p>
<p>And then, tomorrow night, my wife and I are going on a rare date. Babysitter‚Äôs booked. We‚Äôre going to see Sharon Van Etten at Revolution Hall. It‚Äôs been over a decade since I last saw her perform. That was back in Ferndale, Michigan, at this tiny venue called The Loving Touch. It used to be a massage parlor, supposedly, and you could stand so close to the stage you could touch the band. She‚Äôs still under the radar in terms of mainstream fame, but tomorrow‚Äôs venue is much bigger than The Loving Touch. I think it‚Äôll be a great show.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good Saturday. The kind of day that reminds you parenting isn‚Äôt about doing everything right. Just doing your best and finding joy in the rhythm of ordinary things.</p>

<p>I have been determined to not rent a car and mostly took trains and buses everywhere.

Everything has been really efficient and comfortable.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>My brother passed away in March 2021, after battling the brain tumor he had been diagnosed with in 2014. Last month marked four years since his death. Aside from losing grandparents, his passing was the closest loss I had ever experienced. We were just one year and nine months apart and did everything together when we were young. Our relationship became more complicated as we got older, for reasons I won‚Äôt get into here.</p>
<p>Losing a younger brother in his thirties had a deep impact on me, even with the complications in our relationship. I had terrible insomnia for at least a year after he died, and it created a heavy strain on my relationship with my wife, who was pregnant with our daughter at the time. We struggled to show up for each other, and for a while neither of us believed our relationship would make it.</p>
<p>I carried a lot of guilt about living in Oregon and not spending more time with him. He had recently gone through a divorce, which brought him closer to our immediate family, but I wasn‚Äôt there much during that transition. And when his health declined so quickly around Christmas in 2020, I had no idea he would be gone within three months. Living a couple thousand miles away with a job, a two-year-old, and a pregnant wife made it very hard to just drop everything and go.</p>
<p>With all the anxiety and regret, I think I mentally checked out. I avoided processing a lot of what I was feeling. I‚Äôve been embarrassed about that and have even misremembered important details from the days around his death and the months that followed.</p>
<p>For example, I remembered how I felt after speaking at his memorial, but not what I actually said. I had never done anything like that before, especially not for someone so close to me. I was filled with sadness and anxiety, wanting so badly to say the right thing and honor his life. But how does someone do that, especially when the relationship was complicated?</p>
<p>I remember feeling sick and nervous, standing in front of hundreds of family and friends, including his daughter. I wanted to be honest about my emotions and not pretend the relationship was perfect, while still being respectful and sincere. After that day, though, his daughter never spoke to me again and still hasn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>Whether because of that or the general stress I was feeling, I blocked out most of what I said in the eulogy. I fixated on a few lines that might have sounded too personal or critical and convinced myself that I had made a huge mistake. Even though I had read from a script that still sat on my desktop, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to look. My grief and shame built a story that explained the distance and silence.</p>
<p>Recently, I have felt a new sense of calm and self-acceptance, which I credit in part to a fasting routine I started. Today, deep into a 72-hour fast, I finally opened that document. I read the eulogy with a clear mind for the first time since giving the speech. It was almost nothing like I remembered. It was not perfect, but I had been punishing myself for four years for something that did not deserve it. I gave a heartfelt speech through tears and clenched fists, trying to speak honestly about a brother I loved and missed. Even if it had been a mistake, I think it would have been understandable, maybe even forgivable.</p>
<p>I needed to forgive myself before I could reconnect my memory with the truth. More importantly, I needed to forgive myself so I could begin to forgive the family members who may still be trying to navigate their own pain. Grief is incredibly complex. It can take much more time, effort, patience, and courage than I ever expected. I never wanted to learn that lesson, but it has meaning, and I know this will not be the last time I face a great loss. Love you, brother.</p>

<p>Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration doesn‚Äôt like it either.Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%. Portland has implemented the strategy and saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph over the speed limit But criteria for an upcoming round of federal road safety grants say projects aimed at ‚Äúreducing lane capacity‚Äù should be considered ‚Äúless favorably,‚Äù the administration said.</p>

			 <p>An article from a few years back that I still think about sometimes as I grind away in the rat race  and on the hedonic treadmill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The activities that make people happiest include sex, exercise and gardening. People get a big happiness boost from being with a romantic partner or friends but not from other people, like colleagues, children or acquaintances. Weather plays only a small role in happiness, except that people get a hearty mood boost on extraordinary days, such as those above 75 degrees and sunny. People are consistently happier when they are out in nature, particularly near a body of water, particularly when the scenery is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I don‚Äôt agree with the children piece (they bring me a lot of joy), it‚Äôs just a good reminder to touch grass, move your body, and spend time with people you love.</p>

			 <p>AI has its pros and cons, but lately I‚Äôve been using it for mundane tasks that have been making my stressful life a little easier. For example, I‚Äôve been recording long trainings related to a big grant app I‚Äôm working. Taking the transcript and having AI summarize notes for me has been huge.</p>

			 <p>At a concert at Mississippi Studios in Portland between sets, and honestly, I‚Äôm kind of floored. It hit me earlier that the last time I saw Lady Lamb perform here was back in 2019. That was almost six years ago, but with two kids, COVID, and the general whirlwind of life, time has felt like a strange, elastic blur.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs as if part of my life paused when I became a parent. Life hasn‚Äôt stopped being fun. I make a point of doing things I love and getting out as much as I can, especially now that my kids are no longer babies. But it sure is different these days. What a trip.</p>

<p>To be seen by others is the core of being. Perhaps this is why humans are driven to create minds besides our own: We want to be seen. We want to be found. We want to be discovered by another. In the structured loneliness of this modern world, so many of us are passed over by our fellow humans, never given a second glance.</p>

<p>What does it mean to be a self? I think, more than anything else, it means the ability to select between different possible outcomes in order to direct oneself toward a desired outcome: to be future-oriented. When every day is the same, when we are not presented with the necessity to choose between different possibilities, we say we don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel alive‚Äù‚Äîand here I think we guess at what being alive actually is. It is the ability to choose. We live in choices.

			 <p>I needed to get away from my desk today, so I drove out to Metro‚Äôs Killen Wetlands near Banks. I‚Äôd never been there and sort of stumbled across it by accident. Usually I drive south on my lunch break, but today I decided to go west. Washington County is some of the most beautiful countryside anywhere, dotted with farms and nurseries and awesome vistas. It made me wish I had $5 million to buy a couple acres. The upside and downside of the UGB is the high price of land.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today started off pretty slow. While my wife was out for a workout this morning, I stayed home with the kids, and we watched The Mitchells vs. The Machines. Not bad! My son liked it a lot, but my daughter was a little scared by the robots at times. For lunch, we finished off some leftover tacos from last night‚Äôs dinner.</p>
<p>After lunch, I tackled decluttering our bedroom/office. One of my <a href="https://bryans.life/2025/01/01/my-goals-for.html">goals</a> for 2025 was to get our house in order, and this was as good of a place as any to start. Both of us work part time from home and our desk tends to accumulate everything‚Äîpapers, books, random notes and other stuff. It was covered in dust and completely overrun with cables and clutter.</p>
<p>I started by cleaning out my nightstand and organizing our books. I got rid of a bunch of unneeded work papers and other junk, like power cables and random guitar paraphernalia from my recent <a href="https://bryans.life/2025/01/01/had-to-replace-the-volume.html">projects</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while I was finishing up my cleaning I took a pretty big spill down the stairs. It really scared the hell out of me. I was running down the stairs with some trash and a bunch of other stuff in my hands when I slipped on the third or fourth stair from the bottom and landed right on my back between my shoulder blades. For a few minutes I was really worried I might‚Äôve broken a rib or something, but I feel mostly better with just some slight pain. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs gone over the next few days, but I really need to be more careful.¬†</p>
<p>Anyway, I‚Äôm hoping to tackle some other problem areas soon, like the fully stocked and disastrous craft cabinet, our unorganized filing cabinet, and the sometimes terrifying mail area. My goal is to have everything sorted and organized by the end of January. I‚Äôve schedule some days in February to clean up the garage, too, which has slowly become light chaos in the aftermath of the holidays.</p>
<p>Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling overwhelmed, like I never take the lead on plans. I‚Äôve noticed that the weekends just come and go, and I often haven‚Äôt thought about what I‚Äôd like to do with them. At the same time, I felt myself getting snippy and frustrated when I forgot about days being booked up with things I‚Äôd forgotten about or missed. I think my ADHD plays a role in this, as my executive functioning is not great and tends to take an even deeper nosedive in the winter. The short days make it hard to stay motivated, especially after 5 PM, and the post-holiday clutter in the house only adds to the mental load. So I decided to try and get a handle on it.¬†</p>
<p>My wife took the kids to the park this afternoon to hang out with her friend and their kids. While they were out, I took the opportunity to grab some groceries and stopped by Powell‚Äôs to pick up a new yearly planner. I spent a little time at a coffee shop looking over the year ahead and thinking about plans for vacations, time off, and trips‚Äîboth for myself and with the family. After laying it all out, I‚Äôm feeling much more settled and positive about the year ahead now that I‚Äôve got a rough idea about how the year might look.</p>
<p>In addition to life just being life, and busy as hell at that, my son now being in kindergarten has thrown all sorts of wrenches into our normal routine and we‚Äôre still adjusting. In particular, the kid has so many days off school now and we have to make arrangements for all of that. While not unexpected, it just adds a whole new layer of complexity to planning, PTO, vacations, everything.¬†</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also been feeling off physically and wondering if something more than seasonal depression is at play. I‚Äôm planning to schedule an appointment with my doctor and get some lab work done, just to check if my medications or something with my metabolism might be contributing. Depending on the results, I may need to reassess my treatment plan.</p>
<p>For now, I‚Äôm trying to stay focused on what I can control. Cleaning up the house and creating a better environment is a good start. I know things will improve as the days get longer, and having a plan for the months ahead will help. Still, I‚Äôve been thinking about how much I‚Äôd benefit from a weekend away on my own‚Äîa chance to recharge and clear my head.</p>
<p>One step at a time. Today was productive, and that‚Äôs a win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <ol>
    <li>
        Declutter my home. I've never been very good at this, but it's proven to be so much more difficult with two young kids. Still, I know I can do a better job and keep a cleaner house in the process. To start, I might do a <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/packing/">packing party</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consistency in planning ahead for weekends away and other trips. ADHD makes this hard, but I‚Äôm always happiest when I have a well-conceived plan to execute. So many times I feel like I'm being led around by plans that are made for me, or feeling bummed out that a weekend was wasted due to poor planning. While rest is important, my goal this week is to look ahead six months and start marking down weekends for both family and personal getaways and then prepare a list of possibilities to discuss with my wife.
    </li>
    <li>
        I've started to be more intentional about making friends instead of complaining that meeting people is hard. A couple months back, I began going to a meetup group for writers. I put my fears and imposter syndrome aside and said "fuck it". I've really been enjoying it, and I plan to do more of this sort of thing in the year ahead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continue to work on my mental health. I don't want to get into too much of this here, but I've been taking my mental health very seriously and making positive changes to support my growth, including reducing anxiety, improving my focus, setting healthy boundaries with people, thinking positive thoughts about myself, working on my emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity. In addition to continuing therapy, I plan to look into microdosing psychedelics and ketamine therapy, under supervision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consuming music more intentionally. For too long, I‚Äôve let the algorithm guide my consumption, and that‚Äôs what it feels like as opposed to enjoyment. On Wednesday nights (or midweek), I‚Äôm going to make it a habit to find a new artist or album to listen to while folding laundry. This will hopefully help me do better at folding and putting away my clean laundry, which again, my ADHD makes seem like an almost insurmountable task at times.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve my photography. I‚Äôve been inspired by others who post a photo every day, and I would like to try that this year. I got some new camera gear this year and I‚Äôve learned a lot. I‚Äôd like to bring this to the next level.
    </li>
    <li>
        Read more books. After grad school, I got out of the habit of reading consistently. It felt like a chore. This year I almost made my goal of 12 books, and even though I didn‚Äôt succeed in meeting the goal, I successfully started building it as a habit. My goal this year is 21 books, or roughly one every two weeks, with a little wiggle room for grace.
    </li>
    <li>
        Put my phone down more when I default to doom scrolling because of exhaustion. No explanation needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Part two of the previous goal is to be more present with my kids. Again, no explanation needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make more time for myself in healthier ways than retreating. Whether through physical activity, weekends away, community college classes, or just an hour at a coffee shop to write or read, my goal is to improve the ways in which I choose to relax, recreate, and/or create.
    </li>
</ol>

			 <p>After several months of asking questions, trying to understand the coordination of benefits between my dental plan and my wife‚Äôs in preparation for some orthodontia, here‚Äôs the email I finally received from Delta Dental. ü¶∑</p>
<hr>
<p>I have an employee under <strong>Redacted</strong> who wrote in asking how COB works when a married couple both have family coverage through separate employers under Delta and the family is about to initiate an Orthodontal claim. The spouse is an employee of <strong>Redacted</strong> hospital ($2K ortho limit is the plan they are considering). The husband read his policy documents and then called into Delta to confirm his understanding. He feels he has become more confused. Can you confirm:
¬†
¬∑ The primary (which plan will process the claim first when there is dual coverage) is determined by the birthday rule: the parent whose birthday falls first in the calendar year has the primary plan (note it‚Äôs not who is oldest but who celebrates first in any given calendar year).¬†<em>This is correct.</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†Orthodontia has its own limit and under your policy that limit is $1500 and separate from the overall deductible.¬†<em>Correct, though I think you meant ‚Äúand separate from the overall annual maximum‚Äù.</em></p>
<p>The $1500 is lifetime per insured.¬†<em>True</em>¬†and they will check to see if there have been any orthodontia treatments under previous plans, Delta or otherwise.¬†</p>
<p><em>We would only consider if the lifetime maximum has been used under the <strong>Redacted</strong> plan.</em>¬†</p>
<p>So dual coverage for Dental would only be beneficial for Orthodontia if the 2nd¬†policy had higher limits.¬†</p>
<p><em>The lifetime maximum is per plan. For example, if they use their lifetime maximum through <strong>Redacted</strong>, and move to another Delta Dental employer plan with ortho coverage, they will have a new lifetime maximum through that new plan.</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†I‚Äôm not sure what Delta meant when they said ‚Äúthat they would not double cover‚Äù unless they were trying to make the point that a $1500 claim under policy one can‚Äôt be filed as a $1500 claim under policy two ($3000 of payment). ¬†</p>
<p><em>Some employer plans do not allow coordination of benefits. Without knowing any information on the other plan, I am unable to review this.</em> (note: they are the same provider and know the other plan number provided on day 1).</p>
<p>¬∑ If you are currently enrolled under both plans, perhaps the best plan of action would be to have the provider submit a letter of predetermination referencing coverage under both plans.¬†</p>
<p><em>Correct, we always recommend a pre-determination.</em> (WTF so they think I‚Äôm doing now?)</p>
<p>¬∑ If you have dual coverage and file a claim you want the primary plan to have the poorer coverage. Whatever that plan doesn‚Äôt pay can be processed against the second richer coverage. ¬†</p>
<p><em>The <strong>Redacted</strong> plan has standard coordination of benefits rules, so if it is the primary coverage, it will pay according to the schedule of benefits. If the <strong>Redacted</strong> plan falls as the secondary insurance, it will pay up to the higher allowable amount (but will not exceed). Again, I don‚Äôt know the details of the spouse‚Äôs plan, so I can‚Äôt really provide any additional information.</em></p>
<p><em>Here are two very high-level ortho examples. These are very general, as I do not know all the details of the other plan.</em></p>
<p><em>With <strong>Redacted</strong> as primary, and the other plan as secondary (if both plans have standard COB)</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>$6000 orthodontia claim</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>$1500¬†√† <strong>Redacted</strong> (as primary) will pay 50% up to $1500</em></p>
<p>¬∑ <em>$4500¬†√†¬†remaining charges will be sent to secondary insurance</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>Secondary insurance could pay, but will not exceed what the primary allowable is, in this case $1500. Even though they may have a $2000 lifetime maximum, secondary would pay up to $1500 (based on the primary allowable).</em></p>
<p><em>With Spouse‚Äôs plan as primary, and <strong>Redacted</strong> plan as secondary (if both plans have standard COB)</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>$6000 orthodontia claim</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>$2000¬†√† likely 50% up to $2000</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>$4000¬†√†¬†remaining charges will be sent to secondary insurance</em></p>
<p>¬∑¬†<em>Secondary insurance could pay, but will not exceed what the primary allowable is, in this case $2000. But, the <strong>Redacted</strong> plan pays 50% up to $1500, so in this case, $1500 could be paid.</em>
¬†
Also in the event the primary plan‚Äôs non-ortho limit is exhausted, does the secondary plan become primary for the remainder of the plan year with the full limits of that plan minus whatever it has paid out already as secondary?</p>
<p><em>In the event that the annual maximum on the member&rsquo;s primary plan is exhausted, then the member&rsquo;s secondary will continue as secondary because we will still need the $0 payment EOB from Primary to process as secondary. But the secondary COB rules will still apply.</em></p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions!</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

			 <p>As a staunch urbanist, I love the idea of the 15-minute city, but that lifestyle seems out of touch from most people‚Äôs reality. Allowing nearby amenities is easy from a land use perspective, but work, school choice, and childcare are other matters entirely. How do advocates reconcile the problem of most working households needing to commute to wherever they can find work, or needing to drive their children to consolidated schools outside their neighborhood? This is our traffic problem.</p>

Spent some time shopping and had drinks beforehand. We had a lot of fun. NW is a beautiful area. I feel very fortunate.</p>

			 <p>There‚Äôs a development forum I frequent that still uses vBulletin version 3.8.7. That‚Äôs software that came out in 2010. The owner refuses to upgrade and the users won‚Äôt migrate because of their post counts. Is there a way I can throw a browser based CSS skin on it for a mobile style view?</p>

			 <p>Home sick today and feeling a bit wistful. I get this way a lot when I‚Äôm lying around alone with too much time on my hands. I went down a 90s nostalgia rabbit hole and found a couple gems.</p>
<p>The first is from a podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-dont-wanna-grow-up/id1536309467?i=1000603869337">episode</a> titled ‚ÄúWhat did the 90s smell like?‚Äù by We Don‚Äôt Wanna Grow Up.</p>
<p>The other is a YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/CGlNnJJLwDM?si=7L1Jge9ujYHbTfMb">video</a> of a guy flipping through a Seventeen School Zone Special magazine from 1996 that I remember purchasing on a grocery store run with my mom when I was 15. I used to love seeing how kids across the country dressed in the wake of the grunge era.</p>
<p>Isn‚Äôt the internet amazing?</p>

		<a href="https://m.afterword.blog/2024/11/03/not-putting-yourself.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-11-03 09:28:14 -0700">Nov 3, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The strangeness of putting yourself out there. The mere act of expressing that you indeed have social needs, that you crave the connection of others, is one that creates repulsion, in myself (and seemingly <em>with</em> others). The effort required almost makes the desired outcome somehow less desirable.¬†</p>
<p>Even in social situations of late, there is something different in the way we all speak to one another, something missing from the way things used to be. We are all tired, we are all distracted. Going through the motions. Feeding each other the requisite smalltalk. Single-serving ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.</p>
<p>Someone converted a dating app into one for making friendships. All you do is swipe right, how hard could it be? Except even if a connection is made, there isn‚Äôt enough time or energy to put in any effort in responding. Astonishing? Perhaps. Surprising? No.¬†</p>
<p>It‚Äôs easy to start to question what you have to offer the world, other people. That rabbit hole of self-analysis can engulf you too, if you‚Äôre not careful. To dilute all human interaction as transactional, conditional. To begin to see others as if through a small clerk‚Äôs window where someone on the other side is always expecting you to dance, or to make them laugh, or to provide them with some other entertainment or pleasure or connection.¬†</p>
<p>I start to question if I really even want what I think I want. The current assignment is to find shared activities and friendships will bloom naturally. I‚Äôm tired and retreat inward. Find comfort in others who might as well be fictional people on a screen.¬†</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaybe I should sign up for a class,‚Äù I tell myself. Start writing more and care less about what others think. Maybe that‚Äôs what losers tell themselves, I think.¬†</p>
<p>Going through my memory of the people whose social lives you envied, the people who seemed to be a spiderweb of connection between everyone and everything. They all had something in common. They were the people who showed up to everything. Had dinner parties. Volunteered on boards and commissions. Went to happy hours. Played adult group sports. I remember one in particular falling asleep at the table while we ate dinner at her house. But everybody loved them. I still think fondly.¬†</p>
<p>This is certainly all my fault, the loneliness. Who else made the decisions that got me to where I am? ¬†I‚Äôm not carving out enough ‚Äúme time‚Äù. I retreat inward. Find comfort in others who might as well be fictional people on a screen.¬†</p>
<p>Wait, no. It‚Äôs our environment. The American built environment is killing us. The suburbs, it‚Äôs all their fault. It‚Äôs just middle age, this is normal. It‚Äôs the children, they take up too much of our time. It‚Äôs other men. All they want to do is talk about sports and play golf. Right? Female friends, wouldn‚Äôt that be great? Oh wait. We can‚Äôt form new, close relationships with women at this stage of life. They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a creep. Trying to pull something on them and sneak around behind your wife. What will be people think?¬†</p>
<p>Why do you need anything more than you already have? Isn‚Äôt that a sign of insecurity, of weakness?¬†</p>
<p>I retreat inward.¬†</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I‚Äôm about a week in with CICO (calories in, calories out), and although it hasn‚Äôt exactly been easy, I‚Äôve stayed below my calorie limit all but 1 day. I‚Äôm still well below my restriction limit for the week, which means I did better than my expected.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve set a goal of reducing my caloric intake by 800-1000 calories per day below my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which I calculated to be about 3200 calories depending on my physical activity. I've budgeted a little bit more calories for the weekends because I know I tend to eat breakfast or have the occasioanl beer.</p>
<p>I know a lot of it has to be water weight, but I'm down about 6 pounds this week. I know this will level out, and so long as I stay on track, I could lose about 2 pounds per week.</p>
<p>The most difficult part so far is the evening snacking. I‚Äôm noticing my biggest cravings are in the evening. I‚Äôve been trying to eat dense, low calorie foods like carrots.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also finding that I feel a lot more human if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast. Breaking up 2,200-2,400 calories over 3 meals and snacks just seems to be not that much food at a meal for my body size. I do still eat breakfast occasionally, but I‚Äôm much more mindful of how many calories I‚Äôm eating and try to keep it low with a hard boiled egg instead of cereal, which would push me way over the edge.</p>
<p>Even though I'm aiming for 2 pounds per week, my goal is to lose 5 lbs per month until new years, for a total of 25 lbs. From what I‚Äôve been reading, this should be attainable, but never having dropped that much weight before, I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm planning on updating this blog to log my progress. I‚Äôll check in again next week to write an update about how things have been going.</p>

			 <blockquote>‚Äú‚Ä¶[T]he nations with the biggest surpluses of grain have always exerted power over the ones in short supply. Throughout history governments have encouraged their farmers to grow more than enough grain, to protect against famine, to free up labor for other purposes, to improve the trade balance, and generally to augment their own power. George Naylor is not far off when he says the real beneficiary of his crop is not America's eaters but its military-industrial complex.‚Äù </blockquote><p>// The Omnivore‚Äôs Dilemma</p>

			 <p>I slept in today because of the sleeping pill I took in the middle of the night, but I was productive despite how groggy I felt when I woke up. I took 5 big bags of bottles back for the deposits, picked up groceries, and vacuumed my car. I picked up the backyard a little bit and blew the leaves off the deck.</p>
<p>S‚Äôs dad came for a visit today, who was in town for work. It‚Äôs been nice having him swing through more often the last year or so, but sometimes the heads-up is short, and there‚Äôs a lot to do to make the place presentable. S worked her butt off yesterday and today getting the place cleaned up. We try to keep up on it, but having to little kids makes it difficult.</p>
<p>After grandpa showed up, we took the kids to the nature park and went for a couple mile walk through the woods. They were wild, but I think they had fun. It was warming up, but the dense canopy kept up cool.</p>
<p><img src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2024/img-7666.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I had prepped some BBQ before we left and put it on the grill, but it still needed a few more hours to cook after we got back. The family watched a kids‚Äô movie for a bit while I went upstairs and messed around with my blog. The ribs turned out pretty good! We rounded out the meal with some mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.</p>
<p>This evening we folded laundry while the kids took baths. It rained tonight, which is kind of strange for this time of year in the Northwest. June has been strange in general. My garden seems to be loving it, though, and thankfully for that given the issues I‚Äôve had with the drip irrigation recently.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we‚Äôre taking the kids to some park on the Willamette, meeting up with some friends to go paddle boarding. I‚Äôm considering brining the canoe. It‚Äôs supposed to be cloudy but there‚Äôs no rain in the forecast yet. I‚Äôm sure the kids will enjoy it.</p>

			 <p>Found a beautiful yet simple habit tracker in the App Store called Onrise. It‚Äôs free and comes with widgets, pomodoro timer, and a journal. I‚Äôd love to use it but apparently there‚Äôs no way to know where the data is stored or how to export data. Wish I could get Shortcuts and iCloud to work with it.</p>

			 <p>This popped up in photos as a 20-year memory today. This hit me like a ton of bricks. Coachella 2004. Me and some friends drove from Michigan to California, four-deep in a Honda Civic. This is my buddy Trevor. We‚Äôve grown apart and have our own lives now, but I have a lot of good memories.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve saved about $75 in gas in less than 2 weeks with my new car. In reality, it‚Äôs likely more because my Subaru only got about 20 miles per gallon in city driving and this calculation uses 25 mpg as a baseline for comparison. Also had to supercharge the first few days before getting my charger.</p>

			 <p>Couldn‚Äôt sleep last night, at all. Periodic bouts of insomnia are nothing new. So, when I know it‚Äôs a lost cause to even try, I kind of go off the rails digging into basic front end dev. I&rsquo;ve been slowly making the Marfa theme (Hugo/Micro.blog) my own, with little tweaks.</p>
<p>Some things I got done last night:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally figured out my issue with Tinylytics and got both the TinyKudos and the hit counter working.</li>
<li>Was successful in modifying the direction of the pagination since it was intuitively backwards to my eyes. I‚Äôm pretty proud that I figured this out on my own as I was not expecting any of this to be in CSS.</li>
<li>Actually read the plugin instructions on how to properly reference short codes for ‚Äúreply by email‚Äù and ‚Äúreply on Mastodon‚Äù. I spent too long trying to organize these within the author panel under individual posts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Created a prettier link to the ‚ÄúConversation on Micro.blog‚Äù from individual posts. It didn&rsquo;t look right clumped together with the other reply functions, above.</li>
</ul>
<p>I failed at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating Font Awesome so that I could use the Bluesky logo on my Social page. Above my head. Attempted for the first time to fork and modify a plugin, which may have been over the top but a learning experience nevertheless.</li>
<li>Understanding if it‚Äôs possible to use a hamburger menu for navigation.</li>
<li>Still need to figure out if there is a way to get the TinyKudos button into the actual theme for individual posts so I don&rsquo;t have to type it out for each post 
    <button class="tinylytics_kudos" data-path="/2024/05/02/couldnt-sleep-last.html"></button>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On my to-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out how webmentions work in Echofeed. For some reason I&rsquo;m not finding the documentation.</li>
<li>WTF is going on with the formatting of these bullet points.</li>
</ul>

Google documents, first reported by the Intercept in 2022, suggest that the Google services on offer to Israel via its Cloud have capabilities such as AI-enabled facial detection, automated image categorization, and object tracking.</p>

<p>For the last five years or so, I‚Äôve used the space next to my driveway for raised beds. I‚Äôve got a 3,100 gallon rain cistern in my backyard and I hand dug a trench to the front yard for my drip irrigation system.</p>
<p><img src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2024/img-2157.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It‚Äôs worked pretty well, but there are pros and cons. For starters, the beds are pretty close to the driveway, and my wife already ripped my bumper off once and tried to pass it off as if nothing ever happened (I caught it on camera). That was just a one-off incident, thankfully.</p>
<p>Another negative is that I‚Äôve had kids cutting through my side yard on the way to the light rail or on their way home from school. They‚Äôve trampled my pumpkins and zucchini squash a handful of times, and it‚Äôs pretty annoying to have put in so much work to grow a few healthy plants from seed only to have them trampled under foot by a careless teenagers.</p>
<p><img src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2024/img-1095.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôve also had little old ladies stop by and help themselves to some tomatoes, which isn‚Äôt a huge concern, but it does feel a little weird to know my neighbors regularly steal from my garden. I‚Äôd gladly give them the food if they‚Äôd just ask. In fact, I‚Äôve put extra food out with a ‚Äútake me‚Äù sign before.</p>
<p>But really, I‚Äôd like to use that space along my driveway for something else someday. I‚Äôve had this crazy idea for a while now to make our house look a bit like an old craftsman by converting the garage into living space and a front porch.</p>
<p><img src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2024/img-9449.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>If we do decide to go through with the renovation, I‚Äôd like to shift our driveway to the right to make room for a walkway to the entrance. Since our backyard is so shaded, that leaves my front lawn as a new location for our garden beds. This poses a couple of issues though.</p>
<p>First, I‚Äôd have to get the beds moved pretty soon; something I‚Äôm not really looking forward to doing in the dead of rainy season. Another issue is the situation with the rain cistern and having to figure out a new solution since the underground pipes can‚Äôt really traverse the underside of the driveway and would need to go around the other side ‚Äî loads of work that could be done later, but a job I don‚Äôt want to do. Finally, there‚Äôs the issue of my lawn and the appropriate way to retire it without making my yard a complete mess and nuisance.</p>
<p><img src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2024/img-1034.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure I have the time, energy, budget, or motivation to tackle all of this. It‚Äôs a hobby, and one I quite enjoy, but the food is merely supplemental and the cost-benefit ratio can get out of hand fairly quickly if one‚Äôs not careful. Yet I don‚Äôt want to give it up.</p>
<p>Maybe some interim solutions will present themselves in my brainstorming, but right now, I‚Äôm coming up short as to how best to approach the issue.</p>

<p>The worst part about power outages is that I can‚Äôt sleep without my CPAP machine anymore. I have a battery for it to get me by, but I must not have charged it after camping last summer. I got another hour out of it before I was awakened again not being able to breathe.</p>
<p>I had to get creative because I needed sleep. I had an early morning meeting today and needed to get the kids to daycare/preschool earlier than normal since my wife is still in California and couldn‚Äôt help. </p>
<p>I started my car, plugged in an inverter into the cigarette lighter, and ran two extension cords connected together from my car and upstairs to my CPAP machine. I got a few more hours of sleep before I had to start getting ready for the day. </p>
<p>I got enough sleep to get by, but I‚Äôm charging my big back-up battery in case it happens again. </p>

<p>This morning, I accidentally bumped my HomePod while cleaning off the desk and some music started. Land Locked Blues by Bright Eyes came on, from his 2005 album I‚Äôm Wide Awake, It‚Äôs Morning. It‚Äôs making me nostalgic. That is about the time I stopped listening to Bright Eyes and stopped buying CDs altogether. </p>
<p>I was 24 that year. It was before smart phones became popular, and 2005 was about a year after I got my first iPod. I still actively managed my library for a few more years, but that slowly started to change as streaming became more popular. </p>
<p>My music listening habits are so much more random since streaming became a thing. I struggle to even answer when people ask ‚Äúwho‚Äôs your favorite band?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat kind of music do you listen to?‚Äù I miss the more intentional nature of it all when I‚Äôd manage an actual library, even if it wasn‚Äôt in the form of physical media. </p>
<p>I have tried to go back at times and explored the underground and alternative music that I didn‚Äôt have the privilege of knowing or experiencing in my younger years before the Internet, and in this way, I love the archeological digging and discovering. However, that takes a lot of work and patience because it‚Äôs really easy to find a shinier new object of my affection, however fleeting. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think breadth of content has improved anything about the experience for me. If anything, it‚Äôs too easy to push things aside without giving them a chance and I don‚Äôt listen to entire albums very often anymore. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve toyed around with having my own library again on a Plex server, but adding new music is not easy, and if we‚Äôre being honest, it can get expensive in a way that feels unnecessary. Also, I have so many other things going on in my life that I don‚Äôt have a lot of down time to manage it. But these are just excuses. If it were important enough for me, I‚Äôd make it happen. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs entirely likely that the shift in music medium has caused a psychological shift in me in such a way that I care much less about music now than I once did. If I sit with that feeling for any amount of time, I feel a little guilty about it. </p>
<p>All this to say, music feels very cheap to me these days. It‚Äôs everywhere in abundance and therefore it feels much less valuable. As a musician myself, this feels strange to admit, but it‚Äôs what I feel in my gut. I don‚Äôt have a solution, but I wish it were different. </p>
<p>I want that feeling of freedom again, driving around on the first warm day of the year with the windows down, listing to my favorite album. I want that feeling of finding an album and it becoming the soundtrack that defines a season, a year. </p>

			 <p>Recently I got into the world of management and I‚Äôve noticed e-mails coming my way in the evenings and on the weekends from director types and such.</p>
<p>I am committed to my job and enjoy the work, but I‚Äôm not sorry to say that I‚Äôm not getting into a habit of responding to emails on Friday night, midday Saturday, etc.</p>
<p>What I did do yesterday was take my two young ones to a birthday party at Conestoga Recreation Center and ran around a gym for a couple hours while they had the time of their lives. We had a lot of fun and we all got some exercise playing soccer, basketball, etc.</p>
<p>My wife leaves for a trip to California today to visit her grandparents and I will be very busy with the kids by myself until Wednesday night. I‚Äôm happy she‚Äôs going but also a little bit jealous. We‚Äôll be good, though.</p>

			 <p>I slept in until about 8 this morning and watched some Italian IPTV after I blogged a bit about our trip planned for later in the year. I‚Äôve been trying to get into the mindset.</p>
<p>Our friend offered to watch our kids for a couple hours, so we took her up on it so that me and my wife could go to the gym. We went for a swim. I tried to talk her into doing laps outside, but we only made it one lap before she was too cold, so we went back inside and soaked in the salty indoor pool and then hot tub.</p>
<p>I made a single serving friend named John who was in his 70s and seemed lonely, so we talked a bit. He spoke of his nearly 30 years at Intel as a project manager of some sort, how he tried to retire many times but it just wasn‚Äôt the right time and his job kept offering him more flexibility and money. He‚Äôd take summers off with his wife and go sailing around Norway and Sweden, spent a lot of time in Mexico, etc.</p>
<p>He‚Äôd recently had heart surgery and was trying to get back into being a little more active, and his doctor told him that exercising in the pool was good, low-impact activity.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard for me not to envision myself at the end of my life speaking similarly, having similar experiences. Not that I felt sorry for him; he had lived a good life. But with every sentence I imagined myself near the last 10% of my life and looking back and I imagined myself missing the time I am in now.</p>
<p>My kids are still so young but I don‚Äôt want the time to move any quicker right now. They are the loves of my life and I don‚Äôt even like being away from them. I hope that I am able to provide them a life they can look back on with fondness, to see me as someone they are proud of.</p>
<p>I am in a bit of a winter funk right now, but they bring me joy. We are heading out the door for a birthday party for some of my wife‚Äôs friends‚Äô kids, at a recreation center. They‚Äôve rented out the gym. Hopefully chasing around some kids will help shake off the blues. If not, I‚Äôve got a date with the treadmill later.</p>

			 <p>Before the holidays, I had my first phone conversation with a distant cousin I connected with on one of those genetic testing sites. I don‚Äôt make it a habit of reaching out to complete strangers with loose genetic ties, but I had been looking for Italian family on my father‚Äôs side in the United States and he had the same surname as my my paternal grandmother before she got married. I didn‚Äôt have a relationship with my father, so I didn‚Äôt have the benefit of having direct family introductions. So I sent him off a message and we‚Äôve been connected for a few years now.</p>
<p>William lives down in the Berkley area, so it‚Äôs nice we‚Äôre in the same time zone. He‚Äôs in his 60s, has been married for many years, and has kids and grandkids. Our connection is that his grandfather was siblings with my great grandmother Louisa. My great grandmother‚Äôs parents moved to Iron, Wisconsin from Italy for a better life and there were a lot of mining jobs there and in Michigan‚Äôs upper peninsula in the early 1900s. That‚Äôs how one side of my Italian family got here.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spoke to William on the phone and we talked about his trips to Italy that I‚Äôd seen him posting about on Facebook. He‚Äôd posted some photos about his trips to the Dolomites (3 times per year!) where our Italian family is from. We exchanged a few messages and he decided to just call me up on Facebook Messenger instead of typing it all out. It was nice to have a real conversation with someone I‚Äôve never met in real life but for whom I‚Äôve grown to appreciate from afar.</p>
<p>He knew that me and my wife were planning a trip to Italy in late spring, so he wanted to give me tips. I told him of our tentative plans and he guided us to some better decisions, even connecting us with a personal friend and mutual family in Cadore. Two sides of my family are from Vigo di Cadore, and he gave me the details of a great Air BnB the next town over.</p>
<p>I took a sneak peak of the town on Google Street View and the walls of mountains surrounding that area are both majestic and intimidating. The town is Lorenzago di Cadore and I think we‚Äôre going to book the apartment this week.</p>
<p>The way Italian citizenship works through the Jure Sanguinis (citizenship by descent) is that if you weren‚Äôt born there you have to register in the comune (town) of your last Italian ancestor, so I‚Äôm registered up in Vigo di Cadore, right next door. From family records, I have the address of the place where my great grandparents lived and the cemetery where they‚Äôre buried. Although they emigrated to the U.S., they ultimately didn‚Äôt end up liking it here and moved back!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm excited to finally get to visit the area. We are lucky to have my parents watching the kids for us while we‚Äôre away for 10 days, which will be strange for sure, but this will be our first vacation alone of any length in 5 years since having our son. We love to hike and are really looking forward to some mid-elevation hikes in the Dolomites for a few days before we head south. I hear the people are nice and welcoming, and the family I still have there sound excited to meet distant family who were descended from the Italian diaspora of the early 20th Century.</p>
<p>Things are feeling more real and I‚Äôm looking forward to my first international adventure since 2007. Hopefully many more to come.</p>

			 <p>This week, we started going back to 100% analog books at bedtime for the boy and I feel good about it. He‚Äôs almost 5, and we‚Äôve read to him nearly every night of his life since before he was able to understand what was going on.</p>
<p>It started out as 3-4 children‚Äôs books. We ran out of material after a while, so Libby (library app) and Amazon Kids+ filled in the gaps. But over the last 6 months or so, he‚Äôs been wanting more and more to watch books read from content creators on YouTube. We‚Äôd still read him a book or two, but then allow him to watch books being read on YouTube Kids.</p>
<p>The great thing is, he somewhat surprisingly didn‚Äôt complain when we cut out the iPad. It seemed pretty harmless, but we agreed it was basically too much like watching cartoons. The readers often have too much commentary, or act out the characters in the books. He also wasn‚Äôt getting as much explanation or oversight. It took away the fundamental purpose of reading.</p>
<p>His preschool teachers say he‚Äôs ahead of where he should be, doing work of kindergartners and a little bit of first grade work. We don‚Äôt push him too hard on the learning to read and write, but I want to make sure he stays interested and engaged. It will come.</p>
<p>Tonight I read him four books, two of which were longer. I spent more time asking him questions and sounding out some of the words, all the while pointing to each word as I read them. He was really interested, and asked a lot of questions about the meanings of words. It was just nice to have more one on one closeness with him.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had my last cigarette 7 years ago yesterday. Since that time, I've saved something like $25,000 in direct costs and have hopefully added years to my life. I don't write about this anniversary for praise or pats on the back, but instead to honor myself and explore my own feelings on the subject, which are complex. </p>
<p>Avoiding lung cancer and saving money are of course two of the biggest motivations most people cite for wanting to quit smoking. But what nonsmokers might not realize is that many smokers experience profound psychological stress about their addiction, which in my case was what ultimately motivated me enough to successfully quit for good. I wanted to write a bit about this experience.</p><p>Over the course of my life, I've heard countless people express their disdain for smokers, writing off nicotine addiction as a mere habit. These same people paint smokers with a broad brush, characterizing them as low-life, selfish people who could quit at any time if only they'd exhibit a little self control and motivation. I think this thought process is severely flawed and shows incredible ignorance. While some people can more easily quit than others, this is rare and fails to take into account epigenetic and environmental differences. </p><p>It's well documented that nicotine is highly addictive, and the human brain changes dramatically as a result of its continued use. For example, nicotine receptors increase over time and addicted smokers have billions (yes, billions) more nicotine receptors than non-smokers, making it increasingly difficult to quit the longer one smokes. Furthermore, this deep chemical addiction causes new neural pathways to form in the brain as a result behavioral associations, reinforcing the chemical addiction. </p><p>It's a fact that most smokers want to quit, but the vast majority are unsuccessful. For example, around 70% of U.S. smokers say they would like to quit, while 55% have actually attempted quitting in the last year but have failed. As a result of this intense desire to quit, it's not uncommon for smokers to live in denial of the bodily harm being caused by the simple act of inhaling and exhaling smoke hundreds of times per day. For me, this denial was a defense mechanism against the deep existential dread I would feel if allowed to dwell on the reality of my addiction.</p><p>Perhaps even more depressing is that smoking addiction in low-income populations perpetuates intergenerational poverty and poor mental health outcomes. This is because low-income smokers will prioritize smoking over getting higher order human needs and goals met, such as the human needs for safety, food, social belonging, love, and self-esteem, or life goals such as improving their economic situation. Although the bodily harm caused by smoking is much slower than hard drugs, its legality and availability at every corner store makes it virtually impossible to break free.</p>
<p>In my own case, the cognitive dissonance I experienced over 15 years of failed attempts to quit was intense and certainly took a mental and financial toll. Like other smokers, I desperately wanted to quit, not just to improve my health, but to improve my life. I felt that smoking was the major hurdle to reaching my goals and life potential, but I just couldn't get off the treadmill. At one point in my 20s, I was making around $6.50 per hour and was charging my cigarettes to a high interest credit card (25% APY) that ultimately had around $2,000 on it at its highest point ($3500 in today's dollars).</p>
<p>The life consequences beyond health impacts were real as well. Being a smoker severely limited my relationships, most notably my career and dating prospects, and I internalized that as both shame and resentment. Consequently, I went to great lengths to hide that I was a smoker, especially from those for whom I had great respect or romantic interest. I would wear nicotine patches before and during job interviews or dates, trying to keep the smell of smoke off of me, only to light up immediately afterword. I gained a reputation among friends and colleagues as being aloof and clandestine as I frequently absconded from work and social situations to sneak in a cigarette. It's all really silly to me now, but mostly it's just sad that it had such a hold on me. </p><p>Now that I've quit, I certainly enjoy no longer smelling like an ashtray and not having to hide parts of myself from coworkers and other people due to embarrassment. I no longer feel like a pariah. I don't lose my breath going up a few flights of stairs. I probably sleep better. I can certainly tell the vast improvement to my breathing. But there have also been negative consequences as a result of quitting, too. </p><p>Most notably, I have gained quite a bit of weight. I was always a healthy weight as a smoker but I gained 40 lbs after quitting, pushing me into the obese category. This has taken its toll on my self-esteem, energy, and motivation. I have also noticed changes in how people treat me as a result of my physical changes, which can be pretty sad thinking how superficial our world has become. </p><p>I'm proud of myself, but my next goal is to continue working on my mindset. In 2024, I want to work on self acceptance while making small but steady improvements in my physical health through achievable goals and habits. And for those on a similar journey, I wish you strength, health and wellness in the new year. </p><p></p><p></p>

			 <p>I'm just not feeling the holiday spirit this year. Both my kids are young and I am trying to show up for them. I even saved up quite a bit of cash to pay for toys and gifts and take some of that stress off us, but I just can't get in the mood. </p><p>I think more than anything, I'm feeling tired of Oregon and feeling the pull to move back to Michigan. We‚Äôve outgrown our house and feel trapped due to prices and interest rates. Looking at real estate back in the Midwest looks like a bargain. The pay isn‚Äôt even that different in my field, and we‚Äôd have a huge down payment if we sold our current house to buy there. It‚Äôs even more appealing to me also because my family lives there. But I can‚Äôt convince my wife. </p><p>Take for example this house:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1290" height="1517" srcset="https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 600w, https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 1000w, https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 1290w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>It‚Äôs in an affluent suburb with good schools, in a major metro area with good jobs in my field. A house like this barely even exists in Oregon, and the ones that do would cost double what this one is listed for. Here in Oregon, we live in a tiny place in a less desirable location despite being in a higher income group. It‚Äôs crazy to me what is unavailable to us given our education and income levels. We worked so hard to get where we are and barely feel we can get ahead. Why people stay here is beyond me. </p>

Now we are just drinking old fashioneds, eating coconut cream pie, and huddled around the living room watching football and playing with the kids.</p>

			 <p>I have a theory that eyeglass companies switched to polycarbonate lenses from glass, not because of weight or safety concerns, or because polycarbonate was better, but because polycarbonate scratches easily, so you have to replace your glasses more often.</p>
<p>Even with coatings, they just suck in my experience. I scratch up my polycarbonate lenses a couple months after getting them, without fail. I know I‚Äôm hard on them, but it‚Äôs still annoying.</p>
<p>Most local shops and labs don‚Äôt even offer glass lenses anymore. But I found out recently that eyeglasses.com still sells actual glass lenses. So I sent in my existing pair of Warby Parker frames and had them replace the lenses with real glass. Took about two weeks total to send them in and get them back, but they are awesome. $150, reasonable if you ask me.</p>
<p>A little more weight, but the acuity is a lot better and they‚Äôre supposed to have the highest scratch resistance of any material. We‚Äôll see how they hold up.</p>

			 <p>An excerpt from an interview with Noam Chomsky prior to the October 7 conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For 50 years, Israel has been explicitly trying to use the Holocaust as a propaganda weapon to justify crushing the Palestinians, occupying Palestinian territory illegally, practically destroying Gaza [which is] almost unlivable now. A million children can&rsquo;t even get potable water. The constant atrocities in the West Bank. You read journalists like Gideon Levy, Amira Hass, others, daily reports. They think they can get away with this as long as they can wave the Holocaust in front of people&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I should say, this is explicit. So if you go back to 1973, Abba Eban, a leading Israel statesman and highly respected, wrote a very interesting article in the more liberal Jewish journal in the United States, Congress Weekly. In this article, he said the duty of American Jews is to show that any criticism of what he called Zionism, meaning the policies of his government, any criticism is either anti-semitism if it comes from non-Jews, or neurotic self-hatred if it comes from Jews. And he actually mentioned two people. I was proud to be one of them.</p>

			 <p>After two days of public transit and traveling around downtown Portland and Seattle, I‚Äôm really saddened by the fact that my son was just about the only child I saw, and I honestly questioned my parenting by exposing him to certain things on this trip.</p>
<p>I left with him for the KISS concert wondering if maybe he was too young for the show, not even really thinking about the realities of our cities. I figured our quick public transit trips would be no big deal, but our homelessness and drug issues are just so bad, and I regret not driving us up there.</p>
<p>I am used to having regular fears. I‚Äôve lived in seedy areas most of my life. But the fears I had these last two days were not my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fears of guns or cars possibly killing us, or people breaking the window of my car for some change in the center console, or a pick pocket, but rather the potential for my kid being exposed to fentanyl, or the absolutely off-their-rocker people we saw on every bus and train we took, screaming obscenities and racial slurs.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs terribly sad to me that kids can‚Äôt take part in downtown life in this country, particularly on the west coast. Despite the fun times we had, the things he was exposed to fill me with sadness and make me want to leave, for a small town or another country altogether.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a busy couple of weeks. But I guess life is just sort of busy now anyways. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The weather has officially turned over to Fall and we‚Äôve been getting a lot more rain lately. I don‚Äôt mind it yet and the cooler weather has been a welcome change. The next couple of days are supposed to be sunny and I‚Äôm looking forward to it.¬†</li>
<li>My kids and I went to the big box home improvement store and picked up a bunch of Halloween decorations. I dipped into some savings for Christmas because my son is all about this holiday. We got a little witch that dances and sings, a skeleton dog, a fun wreath, and some headstones and dirt to make our front garden box look like a graveyard. It‚Äôs so much fun seeing these things through the eyes of a 4-year-old. My daughter is about 20 months and she isn‚Äôt quite as into them yet. In fact, she‚Äôs a bit freaked out by the witch :D.</li>
<li>The pumpkins I grew did turn orange! I cut them off their vines a few weeks ago and made sure they got lots of sunshine. The largest of the two turned all the way orange and the smaller one is still a little green, but it made me happy to see they had actually turned because I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would.¬†</li>
<li>I started constructing a Mystery Machine (Scooby-Doo) out of boxes I‚Äôd procured, just shaping them into a van for now. This week I promised my son we‚Äôd paint it. I already got the paint from Joann last weekend, just looking for the time to get it started before Halloween. The idea is that I‚Äôll place it on our wagon and take it with us Trick-or-Treating.¬†</li>
<li>This past weekend we checked out a new park in Hillsboro that has a giant troll play structure constructed out of wood. The kids of course loved it. This area really does have a lot to do for kids and is really family friendly.¬†</li>
<li>My son and I got our Flu shots early last week and my wife took our daughter to do the same. Still have to schedule our Covid boosters. P was running around the doctor‚Äôs office and crawling around on the floor. The hospital staff didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. I just shrugged and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs 4‚Äù.¬†</li>
<li>Last week I was busy cleaning up files and finishing some last minute projects as I was exiting my last role at work, and this week I officially started my new job within a different department. It‚Äôs still early, but so far &#8211; so good, and the people are really nice. It‚Äôs a very different world from what I‚Äôm used to, but I welcome the change.¬†</li>
<li>I bought a treadmill and have been keeping up with using it just about every day, sometimes in the morning and other times in the evening. My wife, who was skeptical at first, is even using it a bit herself. I‚Äôve just been throwing on a podcast or some Italian music (I‚Äôm trying to learn) or a show and going to town for 30 minutes to an hour. Nothing too intense yet, but I‚Äôd really started to feel like my body was working against me lately and figured I‚Äôd gone long enough with not having a more regular routine. Hoping I can keep this going and maintain a good, healthy habit. I feel like I‚Äôm sleeping better and my mood is improving, too.¬†</li>
<li>I spoke to my mom a few days ago about her and my dad watching out kids while we go to Europe, hopefully in the spring. Sounds like they are definitely up for coming out to Portland and holding down the fort, which would be awesome. A little scary considering we‚Äôve never left our kids for that long, but my wife and I are pretty much on our own out here without much support from family. It will be good for us to do something for ourselves, however strange that aspect may be. Having had that conversation, I feel like we can finally start planning it for real. I would like to visit my ancestral homeland of Vigo di Cadore, Veneto, Italy for starters. Shar seems really excited to be checking out the Dolomites as there‚Äôs lots of good hiking to do. We haven‚Äôt decided where else we might go, but that‚Äôs top of the list.¬†</li>
<li>I‚Äôve never watched too much sports, but I got an ESPN subscription for this winter because apparently the Lions are actually doing pretty well and I‚Äôd like to watch this as it‚Äôs never occurred in my entire life. My son and I watched the Red Wings last night and they won, 4-0 against the Blue Jackets.</li>

			 <p>Real estate prices have been going down a little, but affordability is still a major issue. For example, a 984 sq. ft. house with 3 bedrooms and 2 baths in my area just sold for $400k.</p>
<p>To put this price into perspective at current interest rates, a buyer would need an annual household income of about $120,000 to qualify with 5% down.</p>
<p>The median income for a family of 4 in the Portland region is $114,400. Median income for all households was $81,149 in 2021, according to the Oregon Employment Department.</p>
<p>You would have to be in about the top 85th percentile of households in terms of income to afford this home in today&rsquo;s market. The payment would be about $3,100 per month on a standard 30-year mortgage.</p>

			 <p>Having been in a software developer heavy social media world for the last year (Mastodon et. al), I‚Äôve come across the word ‚Äúopinionated‚Äù often to describe certain FOSS or site templates.</p>
<p>I understand it doesn‚Äôt exactly have the same meaning in that context, but it got me thinking that being opinionated in my field (urban planning) is equivalent to activism and is heavily discouraged. It can ruin people‚Äôs careers.</p>
<p>This is probably the most difficult part of the job for me. When your livelihood and family rely on you for support, it‚Äôs very difficult to risk it all just to share opinions, particularly unpopular ones.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I thought conformity was stupid. As an adult, I see it as necessary for survival. And my thoughts on freedom have changed as a result. I‚Äôm now thinking that people that make their own lunch so to speak, the business owners and self-sufficient, the wealthy, are the only ones who can truly share their open and honest opinions without major repercussions.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs amazing how critical we can be of ourselves and our art. All these years of playing guitar and singing and I‚Äôve never released anything official because of fear of my abilities and anxiety about what others will think. I get a lot out of playing for myself, but it would be nice to put something out into the world.</p>
<p>I have been considering doing something ambitious and writing a song per week for a year. Maybe starting a second Micro.blog account for it and using the podcast hosting to do quick acoustic songs with no mixing or editing. Just let them be what they are.</p>

			 <ul>
<li>The kids are watching a movie (Spy Kids: Armageddon) and my wife is off with her girlfriends paddle boarding. We‚Äôre winding down after a somewhat stressful week while DW gets some much needed time for herself.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I finished a big report I was writing for work early in the week, a few weeks early no less, so I feel like I can release some of the extra anxiety that has been burdening me unnecessarily. I‚Äôve also been waiting on some pretty important work news since May and I still haven‚Äôt gotten any word about it. As a result, I haven‚Äôt been sleeping the best again and it‚Äôs made for some tougher days than normal, especially with the kids.<br /><br /></li>
<li>My daughter was sick and throwing up earlier in the week, so I ended up not working on Tuesday and just taking care of her. It was nice to spend some one-on-one time with her like I did with my son when he was her age. She got over her stomach bug pretty quickly, thankfully.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I actually picked up a couple new pieces of clothing. I have a habit of not spending much money on myself in this respect. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm surprised when I look back at pictures from a few years ago and see myself wearing something that is still in my current wardrobe. So this week I made it a point to go through my things and pull out some stuff that I‚Äôm not super thrilled to be wearing anymore and bagged it up to donate. I went up to Marshall‚Äôs and actually found a pair of jeans from a brand I like (Madewell) for about 1/5th the cost of new. I like this brand because they don‚Äôt use logos and the cuts seem to fit me well.<br /><br /></li>
<li>It‚Äôs the last day of summer and my favorite time of the year in this part of the world. We‚Äôve been having some pretty clear days, which have been fairly warm and clear but not too hot. Rain is on the horizon, so I‚Äôm soaking it up.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Halloween is right around the corner and we are all planning on going around the neighborhood dressed up as the Mystery Inc. gang from Scooby-Doo. I am wanting to construct a Mystery Machine out of cardboard, some paint, and a wagon. So I should probably get started on that maybe this weekend. My son and I picked up some decorations from Home Depot, including a nearly full-size skeleton that we hung on the front of the house. I‚Äôm also growing some pumpkins for the very first time. The largest of the two appears to be slowly turning orange.<br /><br /></li>
<li>I am feeling pretty good heading into the holidays coming up. I have been diligent about putting away a little money here and there for Christmas so we can hopefully just enjoy the season and not stress out about money or over-extending ourselves and putting things on credit. <br /><br /></li>
<li>I got a few small things done around the house despite not getting my drywalling project in the kitchen done. I swapped out the valve for the bathroom shower so it no longer drip drip drips! I also fixed the door to my daughter‚Äôs room so it doesn‚Äôt stick when you open or close it. This was a pain when we‚Äôd just put her to bed and the door would squeak when we attempted to leave the room, sometimes waking her up. Used a huge 6‚Äù cabinet screw in place of a hinge screw to bring it truer. Good to have these small annoyances taken care of. Hoping to make more progress on the drywall project this week.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes a breakfast burrito can reorient the direction of a bad morning and turn your day into a better one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be more careful with knives. I almost sliced myself pretty badly being careless with my pocket knife while cutting a fishing line for my son. Thankfully I was only grazed. It is not entirely inconceivable that if I had not eaten that breakfast burrito in the morning, I might‚Äôve spent the afternoon getting stitches.</p>

			 <p>As a parent with anxiety, I can already tell that raising two young children to have confidence in themselves, and to approach new and uneasy social situations with bravery, is going to be difficult for me.</p>
<p>I had a difficult childhood, complete with a fatherless upbringing and abuse, which affected me in various ways, including low self-esteem. I didn‚Äôt participate in many extra curricular activities due to my anxiety. I struggled in school for that reason, too, both socially and academically.</p>
<p>Now I have to work up the courage myself to encourage my kids to participate in healthy activities when it doesn‚Äôt come natural to me. The thought of even being on the sidelines of sporting or music events gives me the a lot of stress. What a strange thing to follow you through life. I guess this an example of generational trauma, in the mildest sense.</p>

<p>I had a flashback this morning as I was getting the kids ready for school that reminded me of a time in my life when everything was so unsettled and chaotic. This seems to happen to me a lot more whenever summer starts to give way to fall, when I can smell the change of season in the air and the evenings get a little bit shorter. The memories of back-to-school anxiousness come flooding back and I get a pang somewhere in the recesses of my brain. Usually I‚Äôm transported back to being 13 and crying in the dressing room at Sears while trying on school clothes, but today‚Äôs memory was different.¬†</p>
<p>A couple of decades ago, after my third term at an enormous university, I flunked out of engineering school. It used to be a pretty big source of embarrassment for me, but after many years of learning about myself, I've come to understand the difficulties I experienced then were less a personal failure than they were the very obvious result of my crippling anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD. I no longer look at that time negatively, but rather an inflection point in my life when I had begun to understand myself better.¬†</p>
<p>For the next two and a half years after dropping out, I worked various service jobs and other menial labor for minimum wage, which was $5.15 per hour. I had worked as a pantry cook, gas station attendant, cell phone sales rep, water purification system sales rep, surf and skate shop associate, and I even working for an asbestos abatement contractor one summer. I was always broke and things weren‚Äôt going so great, to say the least. Often I found myself wondering what could have been and fell into a major depression.¬†</p>
<p>There were a few more twists and turns over this time period that I won‚Äôt get into here, but this week marks the 20-year anniversary of me going back to school and restarting my educational journey at a community college. After two years there, I transferred back to university and finished a bachelor‚Äôs degree, only to find myself working in a kitchen again because of the Great Recession. During this time, I applied to graduate programs. I was accepted at a top 3 public university, and a couple of years later I received my master‚Äôs degree in urban planning. As a result of that, I was finally able to gain a foothold in some meaningful work that actually paid a living wage at the ripe old age of 29. And the rest is history, or so they say.¬†</p>
<p>I likely would have avoided a lot of this hardship had I had financial support, well-connected parents, or even health insurance and medication for my anxiety. However, the fact that I did it on my own is a great source of pride now. I look back fondly at my time at community college. In a lot of ways, it was my best higher ed experience of all three I attended. But more than that, it laid the groundwork for the life I love now.¬†</p>

			 <p>I was having a text conversation with my brother this evening. He hadn‚Äôt heard of ChatGPT yet, so I showed him an example and he told me that this reminded him of that song by Tool about California being flushed away into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>I said, ‚ÄúArizona Bay?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>I asked ChatGPT again: ‚ÄúTell me about the song ‚ÄòArizona Bay‚Äô by Tool.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was its response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Arizona Bay&rdquo; is not a song by Tool. However, it is a term coined by the band&rsquo;s lead singer, Maynard James Keenan, and it is the title of a comedy album by comedian Bill Hicks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill Hicks was a renowned American stand-up comedian known for his thought-provoking and often controversial material. He frequently discussed topics such as politics, society, and religion in his performances. &ldquo;Arizona Bay&rdquo; was recorded in 1996 and released posthumously in 1997, following Hicks' death.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The term &ldquo;Arizona Bay&rdquo; itself refers to a hypothetical scenario where the state of Arizona, along with parts of Southern California, would be submerged underwater due to a massive earthquake, resulting in the creation of a new coastline. Hicks used this concept as a metaphor for his vision of a better society, one that would emerge after the collapse of the current societal and political systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Maynard James Keenan, being a fan of Bill Hicks, drew inspiration from his work and incorporated some of Hicks' ideas into Tool&rsquo;s music. Although &ldquo;Arizona Bay&rdquo; is not a song by Tool, the band has paid tribute to Bill Hicks in their performances and even sampled some of his comedy bits in their songs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So while &ldquo;Arizona Bay&rdquo; may not be a Tool song, it holds significance in the band&rsquo;s history and the influence of Bill Hicks on their music and worldview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After my younger brother died in 2021, I couldn‚Äôt shut off the anxiety at night, so I often distracted myself with my phone. I got maybe 3-4 hours per night for like a year.</p>
<p>In addition to working through my grief, a combo of putting the phone down at a reasonable time, using earplugs, and dialing in the CPAP have been key for me.</p>
<p>I now get a solid 7 hours and wake up without an alarm. My mental health has improved a lot as a result.</p>

			 <p>Normally I try to keep things fairly light and impersonal here. I may tend toward the dark or sarcastic from time to time, but over all, I‚Äôm usually a pretty happy person. However, lately I‚Äôve been feeling a little more easily bruised, overly sensitive, and just generally melancholy. I‚Äôve been wanting to write a little more at length in hopes of lifting some of the weight up off from me, but life‚Äôs been pretty busy lately up until right now. And so here I find myself after some dust has settled.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve just joined me, or stumbled across this place, my blog, or even if you‚Äôre just passively following me from some federated service, you'll probably want to take a pass on reading any more of this post. Fair warning: this is just my petty ramblings for my own personal therapy, nothing more.¬†</p>
<p>So, as I said, I‚Äôve been experiencing some mild depression lately. This is pretty out of character for me given that it‚Äôs mid-summer. It's not the same old SAD-induced stuff I‚Äôm used to experiencing in brief episodes during the wintertime when I‚Äôve long been trapped indoors for weeks and Vitamin D deficient. My skin has been sun-drenched and the evenings have been long. By most accounts, I shouldn‚Äôt feel like I do.¬†</p>
<p>Although nothing super weighty has happened in my life recently, I‚Äôm coming out of a few bad years. I thought I got through most of my feelings, but my grief still pokes its head out from time to time, and sometimes smaller things add up to more than their constituent parts, especially when they're piled up on top of that previous stuff.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs been bothering me more recently, for example, is that some summer plans have just not gone so well. I took my four-year-old son to Michigan recently to celebrate my step-dad‚Äôs 60th birthday. And to be completely honest, I didn‚Äôt really want to go at first and had to really rally and build up my motivation because the last several trips home haven‚Äôt been the most positive experiences.</p>
<p>For example, a few years ago I flew back home in support of my mom when she was going through post-op chemo for breast cancer. I went back again a couple of years later in 2021 when my brother went into hospice, where he then died a couple weeks later from the brain tumor he had been fighting since being diagnosed in 2014. Then, last year, some drama unfolded between my youngest (living) brother and his now ex-wife over some custody issues with my nephew, all while my whole family was there vacationing.</p>
<p>So, I might be excused from not being totally thrilled at the prospect of returning. Although much of it was well beyond anyone‚Äôs control, it sometimes feels like bad energy just surrounds the place, and I‚Äôve begun to dread going ‚Äòhome‚Äô for these kinds of visits because something is always.going.down. My wife even refused to go back this year given past years' experiences, so she stayed here in Oregon with our daughter.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I did my very best to put my negative feelings aside, for my dad‚Äôs sake, but also for my son, who still hadn‚Äôt met any of his cousins yet. So I put on my game face and tried my best to just roll with it. And it all really had been going pretty well, too, until about halfway through the trip when I had an argument with my brother and my parents.</p>
<p>It started when I had something come up at work while we were up at their RV park vacation home, so I had to finish a few things remotely. No big deal. I had already discussed with my parents that I‚Äôd have to work a little on this trip, so it wasn‚Äôt completely unexpected. They were just happy we were there.</p>
<p>So when this bit of work came up, my dad asked if he could bring my son down to the beach for a while. I agreed, enthusiastically. My dad‚Äôs a great guy and really good with the grandkids. We had just been to the beach the day before and we all had a great time. I figured it would be great bonding time for all of them. Thumbs up. So away they went.¬†</p>
<p>When I finished my work about an hour later, I walked down to the beach to join them. At first, I thought everyone had left because I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone there. But then I noticed my son‚Äôs voice from afar. Surprised, I saw that he was swimming a long ways from shore. And although he was wearing a life jacket, he was about 35-40 feet out from the beach, essentially unsupervised.</p>
<p>It turned out that my dad had left to take a friend back to camp and he put my brother in charge over my son. However, my brother wasn‚Äôt anywhere within line-of-site of my son when I arrived. He was in the water, but on the other side of a floating dock, completely out of view. My son, who cannot swim, was playing by himself in 15 feet of water without an adult watching over him.¬†</p>
<p>How long had he been out there? How long had no one been watching him? I struggled to make sense of what was going on. At first, I gave my brother the benefit of the doubt. I just watched. With me there watching, I knew my son wasn‚Äôt in any real danger, but I observed to see who was paying attention. As time went on, it became clear that my four-year-old son was really out there all on his own.</p>
<p>No one was paying any attention to him for at least the 5 minutes I was observing, long enough for something to go horribly wrong. I watched long enough for me to have seen my 4-year-old son struggle to get out of the way of other kids much older and larger than him, playing and jumping off the floating dock in his vicinity. Some kids were jumping right over his head, and he showed signs of struggling to stay above water. It was at this point that I called to him to shore, my brother still out of view on the other side of the floating dock.</p>
<p>Once back to shore, I kept my cool and didn‚Äôt yell, but I told my brother in a bit of an upset tone that my son shouldn‚Äôt have been that far out, and that he definitely shouldn‚Äôt be left unattended like that. He quickly got offended by this, arguing that my son wasn‚Äôt unattended. He acted as if it would‚Äôve been impossible for anything to happen to him while wearing a life jacket.</p>
<p>I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. The icing on the cake was when my brother said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome for entertaining your kid for the last couple of hours.‚Äù This just left me feeling very hot given that I had just spent 5 hours with his son without my brother the day prior, like he was doing me some enormous favor by spending an hour with my son, his nephew. I know he was just deflecting the fact that he failed to provide the most basic level of care and oversight to my son.¬†</p>
<p>I was upset at him, but more than anything, I was upset with my dad for his negligence. Later, my brother told me that my dad didn‚Äôt even tell him that he was leaving. I was flabbergasted. My dad‚Äôs brother died by drowning at the age of 18, so this fact surprised me even more.</p>
<p>To top things off, my parents sided with my brother, and my dad basically denied any wrongdoing. My mom has always been protective of my youngest brother, but this was just over the top. She blamed me for stirring up things unnecessarily.¬†</p>
<p>I went over the situation again and again in my head to analyze whether I had done something wrong or if I had overreacted. I felt like I was being gaslighted. I wanted to leave, but I was trapped because I was far out in the country and didn‚Äôt have a car. And to make matters worse, my dad‚Äôs 60th birthday party was to be the next day, the entire purpose for the trip.¬†</p>
<p>Thank God nothing happened to my son, but I kept coming back to those first few moments when I saw him out there in the water alone. My stomach turns at the thought. But to be made to doubt the own validity of my feelings instead of acknowledging a mistake and just apologizing? I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that this experience had me looking back and questioning my own upbringing.¬†</p>
<p>It all left me feeling completely disappointed and disrespected by people I thought had more common sense than this, people whom I thought I could trust. I am still working through a lot of feelings about it.</p>
<p>I spent the evening and much of the rest of the next day removing myself from the situation, staying in another camper. The following evening, I smoothed things over with my brother for the good of the order. It felt like I was lying to myself in doing so, but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my dad‚Äôs big event. I‚Äôm still feeling deeply hurt by what went down and I‚Äôm having trouble trying to figure out how I can move forward given that it‚Äôs gone completely unacknowledged since.¬†</p>
<p>I left Michigan still pretty salty, but was trying to forget about it, focus on the positive, and look forward to a camping trip I had planned on the Oregon coast the following week‚Äîthis past weekend. I booked the trip six <em>months</em> ago because state parks open up their registration that far in advance and the good places fill up pretty much instantly out here in Oregon (maybe it‚Äôs the same elsewhere, too). I knew the trip would be difficult with a young family, but I really thought we would have a lot of fun, too. Turns out we were not ready for that kind of trip.¬†</p>
<p>After days of preparation and loading the van to the roof liner, it was five hours by car until we reached our destination. My first mistake. My one-year-old daughter screamed and cried for at least half of that trip downstate, likely setting some kind of record, but also laying the groundwork for a pretty rough trip.</p>
<p>Both kids thankfully fell asleep right before we got there, which allowed me and my wife to setup camp fairly quickly and undisturbed. We thought we had gotten over the hump, that we could just enjoy our time there, but unfortunately we were wrong.</p>
<p>The coast ended up being pretty cold at night, dropping down into the upper 40s and low 50s, but it was the 35 mph wind gusts that really did us in. My wife, who had on several layers of clothes, a sleeping bag, and blankets, couldn‚Äôt handle the cold. Then, my daughter kept waking up periodically throughout the night before waking up permanently at between 4 and 5 a.m. each morning. As a result, we were all pretty miserable the entire time despite being in such a beautiful place. After two nights of that, we promptly packed up the van and checked ourselves into the nearest Best Western.¬†</p>
<p>For the most part, that went a lot better, albeit with an underlying air of defeat that permeated everything we did the remainder of the trip. Still, $500 later, we had a pool, a hot tub, and a couple warm beds to sleep in. But that wasn‚Äôt the end of it.</p>
<p>Everywhere we went, the kid (my daughter) screamed. Hour trip up the 101 for a hike? Screaming child. Trying to grab some grub at a local brewery with great food and beer? Fussy, crying, screaming child. Spending time at the beach? Screaming child. I think she had just had enough of the road trip life. We all did. I lost my cool at one point and raised my voice, which I regret, feeling completely wiped myself. Most ironically, my son had a great time through all of it and didn‚Äôt want it to end. But for me, these experiences have made me want to stay home for the next couple of <em>years</em>.</p>
<p>I would sometimes think how great it was that I had the opportunity to really plan for my family. That unlike my mom, who was thrust into motherhood as a teenager, I started a family in my late 30s because I had lived so much, settled into my career, and was so financially stable. But then other times, I am just so completely drained that I think I must have been crazy to think this would be easier.</p>
<p>At any rate, the month of July can go to hell. I will remain within a 15 mile radius for the foreseeable future. I love my family and I love my life, but this summer is testing me. Until next time.¬†</p>
<p>Love, Dad</p>

			 <p>Long couple of days, but feeling more alive today after some rest and lots of coffee.</p>
<p>Got in about 2 a.m. (5 a.m. Eastern) the night before last. Had a couple hour delay with our connecting flight out of Seattle. All told, a 13-hour travel day with my 4 y.o.</p>
<p>Carried him (40lbs) and his cargo about a mile according to my watch. My legs and arms definitely feel like they got a workout today. I guess that‚Äôs how we acquire that coveted ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù.</p>
<p>Overall, Pax was a trooper though, and is a great traveler despite me having kept him up way past his bedtime.</p>
<p>At one point, he spilled a half-full glass of apple juice all over himself an hour into our 4.5 hour flight from Detroit and had to fly pants-less (pictured here) for the remainder of the flight. I dried him off with a clean pair of undies I brought in my carry-on, and away we went. I don‚Äôt think he minded so much.</p>

So his kid (5) and my kid (4), first cousins, just met for the first time (in person). We‚Äôre all ‚Äúcamping‚Äù this weekend at my parents‚Äô RV site. How freaking fun this is already to watch them together!</p>

			 <p>One super shady practice by Oregon realtors is the almost universal inclusion of unfinished basement space in the overall square footage in home listings. I often see houses listed at double their actual livable square footage. Buyers should do their due diligence and get the actual livable area from the county tax assessor. Often this info is public and sometimes it‚Äôs online. In the Portland area, you can look up any property at <a href="https://www.portlandmaps.com">Portland Maps</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of putting up a fence, I decided to clear away some landscaping for a path around my garden. It doesn‚Äôt take a degree in urban planning to know these two roads should‚Äôve connected.</p>

			 <p>I grew up in a very poor neighborhood in Saginaw, Michigan. I lived in a 900 square foot house with 7 other people. 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom.</p>
<p>My mom was a teenager when she had me. My mother and I, and later my two brothers, all lived with my grandmother, also a single mother, who still had 3 kids of her own at home.</p>
<p>Yet, by some stroke of luck, our part of the neighborhood was included in a very good school district. Six houses separated us from a very poor inner-city school.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I‚Äôm amazed by what some of the neighborhood kids grew up to become given their home environments, especially compared to some of the kids who were inside the city‚Äôs school district. Several kids who grew up on my street, including myself, have graduate degrees. One of my closest friends as a kid is an attorney in Chicago.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs sad to think schools can have such disparate impacts on kids. The families on either side of the line weren‚Äôt any different from ours in terms of socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>As a humanitarian, as a city planner, I wish we could solve the problem of our schools. Good, properly funded schools would go a long way toward solving so many of our societal ills. I think a decent education, along with affordable healthcare for all, are human rights, and the bare minimum any wealthy society should provide to its citizens.</p>

			 <p>I didn‚Äôt get to drywalling the kitchen ceiling yesterday. As I was squaring up some existing drywall in preparation for placing the patch, I noticed another small leak in the drain pipe below the master bath. My wife was just finishing up giving the kids a bath, and a small amount of water was coming out from the top of the P-trap. This appeared to be an error the plumber made when they built my house. Small annoyance, but I‚Äôm glad it showed itself before I closed things up. Homeownership, man.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had the time to conquer anything this big in terms of home projects. Honestly, I don‚Äôt have many full days to dedicate to projects like this, but I‚Äôve been sneaking in an hour or two here and there. Even though it‚Äôs nothing fancy, it feels good to work with my hands.</p>
<p>Last week I removed a soffit, which previously held some cabinets I removed a few years back. Mostly I‚Äôve just wanted to remove it because it was aesthetically ugly and functionally useless.</p>
<p>However, we‚Äôve always heard a ‚Äúknocking‚Äù noise from this area whenever anyone showers. It was just enough to be annoying. So, two birds, one stone.</p>
<p>The knocking was from the expansion and contraction of a plastic pipe across wood. Whenever hot water rushed through the cold pipe, it rubbed against a joist ever so slightly.</p>
<p>Thankfully I did open it up, though. This is right below where two showers meet on the second floor, so lots of tight plumbing. Turns out that the master bath shower drain had a small leak. We were worried something like that might be the case and didn‚Äôt want mold growing under there.</p>
<p>I pulled out the side wall because it wasn‚Äôt mounted well and bowed in the middle. I also wanted to check for mold there.</p>
<p>On Friday, I replaced the side wall with mold resistant drywall and added outside metal corners. Yesterday, I fixed the leak (and the knock). Tomorrow I drywall the ceiling and start patching.</p>
<p>Honestly, I might hire out the texture. I‚Äôve never done a job this big and it‚Äôs pretty much right in the middle of our house. If I screw that up, there‚Äôs no hiding it.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a result of my upbringing, or just a desire to do something with my hands in direct opposition to my desk job, but I love DIY home renovation.

			 <img src="uploads/2023/d6bac56bab.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="">
<p>On the drive to school this morning, the kids were being unusually quiet, so I asked my 4-year-old son if he‚Äôd thought anymore about what he wanted to be when he grows up.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs been really interested in Spider-Man lately, so I was expecting to hear the usual stuff like ‚Äòsuper hero‚Äô or ‚Äòfireman‚Äô. But he flipped the script and said he wanted to cut tumors out of people. That caught me off guard and tugged at my heart strings a little.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I‚Äôve had to have some tough conversations with him from a pretty young age. One of my younger brothers (his uncle) died in 2021 of a brain tumor at age 37. It was a mixed glioma he had been dealing with for 7 or 8 years, the incurable kind. It was a terribly sad time in my life, one that no doubt impacted my family life. As a result, my son has asked us a lot of questions about my brother and the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>
<p>These are not topics I ever expected to discuss with him at such an early age, and I hate having to tell him about these realities of life. My natural inclination is to shelter him, and I‚Äôve tried to avoid the topic when possible, or to reframe the discussion, but he is very perceptive and can be quite persistent.</p>
<p>I try to wrap these conversations up within feelings of gratitude for the lives we have, or in celebration of the life he lived, or with a focus on being in the present moment. But I also don‚Äôt want to deny his real feelings on the issue. It‚Äôs a lot for a kid to process, coming into awareness of our finite nature, but it‚Äôs clear he knows when I‚Äôm not being completely transparent with him.</p>
<p>This morning, he didn‚Äôt mention my brother directly when he brought up the tumor comment, but I‚Äôm certain that‚Äôs where the idea came from. I used this as an opportunity to talk to him about what a surgeon does, how they help people, and that it requires learning a lot of science and how our bodies work. I told him that he could absolutely be a surgeon one day.</p>
<p>I didn‚Äôt have a dad at his age, so I‚Äôm especially sensitive to how my words and actions might influence him. Whether he becomes a surgeon or a mechanic, I hope more than anything that I can be a good role model for my kids, and to do a decent job preparing them emotionally to recognize their blessings, weather the difficult times, and have the confidence to go after their dreams.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If I could talk to my teenage self, I would try to convey just how much value there is in being in a field that‚Äôs in high demand, and to maybe try to focus on getting a creative role in such a field.</p>
<p>For the most part, I like what I do as a planner, but there is very little creativity, and the options are extremely limited in terms of where we can go. It hamstrings your ability to move about the country or world, or work remotely for yourself, when you have a career in a field that is so competitive and tied to locations.</p>
<p>When looking for a job as a planner, not only does there have to be an opening where you want to live, but also the competition is incredibly high for these jobs. Hundreds of people applied for several of the jobs I‚Äôve held. It took me 5 years of applying to land a job in the Portland region because I didn‚Äôt live here already or know the state and local land use policies. I had to take a job in an allied field for a few years in order to make my way into a planning role within the same organization.</p>
<p>The universities just produce too many of us land use urban planners, selling it as a much more interesting and desirable role than it actually is. What we‚Äôre sold is this idea that we‚Äôll all be designing livable cities and helping communities become better places. But in reality, It&rsquo;s mostly thankless work, often viewed as obstructionist to people‚Äôs hopes and dreams, and very bureaucratic. We are blamed for things beyond our control, when in reality we implement plans driven by elected officials and their constituents in the community. Too much of our jobs are dictated by accommodating the automobile, too.</p>
<p>It took so much struggle and hard work to get where I am now, in both my career and in getting to my current location. I am only now at a senior level in my 40s when many of the people with whom I went to grad school left the field altogether long ago to chase better jobs, in better locations.</p>
<p>Right now, my wife and I are still pining to move abroad for a couple years with our small children. But I am struggling thinking of anything I could do to make a living. There really is no way for me to do my current work and go on such an adventure. I can‚Äôt help but think that if I had gone into another role, I would have a lot more flexibility. I am having some regrets about my life choices in this respect.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://m.afterword.blog/2023/06/05/i-bought-my.html">Trying to remain grateful for what we have despite feeling like we&#39;re outgrowing our house. </a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://m.afterword.blog/2023/06/05/i-bought-my.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-06-05 11:18:05 -0700">Jun 5, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I bought my house in 2016 before I was married or had kids. Coming from the Midwest, housing prices were pretty crazy out here in the Portland region. Not like the Bay Area by any means, but I only had my own income. I was pre-qualified for a mortgage based on my Midwest salary the year prior. I had very limited options, so I bought a short sale fixer upper.¬†</p>
<p>When I moved in, the place was in really rough shape. It had been a rental and I'm told that the last renters had multiple animals, including a potbelly pig. I keep a copy of my inspection report, not only as a list of things that need to be done, but as a reminder of how far it‚Äôs come. I‚Äôve done most of the work myself, something I‚Äôm pretty proud of considering most of our neighbors even hire out their yard work. Blame it on my blue collar Midwestern upbringing.¬†I‚Äôve invested a lot of sweat into the thing. I have an emotional attachment to the place.¬†</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs still a lot to do. It‚Äôs still got some pretty ugly laminate flooring downstairs and an old, dated kitchen from the 80s. And there are a few partially completed projects around the house. Those don't bother me too much, although I'm certain my wife might have something to say about that (she says we're not buying another house that isn't "done" -- I don't have the heart to tell her that it's not ever "done"). </p>
<p>What bothers me is that it can feel like the walls are closing in on me now that we‚Äôre a family of four. Our house is 1300 square feet and it feels like we‚Äôre always right on top of one another. But for us to move into a larger house, we‚Äôd be looking at tripling our house payment.</p>
<p>The plus side of this is that our housing costs are very low. Most of the houses like ours are selling for about double what we paid. Our monthly housing costs are one-half to one-third of what many of our friends pay. For now, this is suiting us fine, especially considering that we have two children in daycare that costs us a couple thousand dollars per month</p>
<p>Some other financial positives are that, as a result of keeping our housing costs low, we‚Äôre able to save 20% for retirement and also put away a few hundred dollars per month for the kids‚Äô college funds. We don‚Äôt have a lot left over at the end of the month, but we have an emergency fund that we almost never have to touch and don‚Äôt have to budget every penny we have.¬†</p>
<p>We don‚Äôt have any pressure to move except for our own desires. I‚Äôm trying hard to ignore my feelings, but I think social media hasn‚Äôt helped (one more reason to perhaps get off it). Since I come from a place where housing prices are way less, I get so see a lot of people back home posting photos of living in beautiful houses. I‚Äôm trying very hard to ignore my own jealous feelings and to deny my very American drive toward ‚Äúmore, more, more‚Äù, but on the other hand, why should it be so tough when we are considered upper middle class? I know we have so much more than most. I am grateful for what we have. Still, our homes are more than just backdrops, they frame so much of our daily lives. I am still trying to sort my feelings out on this stuff.</p>

			 <p>Spent a good chunk of the weekend cleaning the house and making the yard look presentable because we¬†had some friends and family over on Sunday for a barbecue.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_2268.jpeg" src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2023/219318ddaf.jpeg" alt="IMG 2268" width="3024" height="4032" border="0" /></p>
<p>The kids played with water balloons and a cheap slip and slide I picked up from Sierra. It was kind of cold but they didn‚Äôt seem to mind.</p>
<p><img title="IMG_2176.jpeg" src="https://m.afterword.blog/uploads/2023/4ee902ceda.jpeg" alt="IMG 2176" width="3024" height="4032" border="0" />When they tired of that, they played on the tire swing. That has to be the one thing I‚Äôve ever done that has ever been worth anything, installing that tire swing. It has paid for itself in free entertainment. No matter who comes over, they‚Äôre always using the tire swing.¬†</p>

<p>We all sat out on the back deck, had a few drinks, and ate too much food. My mother-in-law and one of her good friends' family came, too.</p>
<p>After our barbecue, we ran over to the coast on Monday for a short hike. Both of the kids seemed to really enjoy it. I was a little frustrated at first because the trails weren‚Äôt clearly marked and we couldn‚Äôt find the waterfall we were looking for. But it was hard to stay in a foul mood because the weather cleared and the beach was pretty nice.¬†</p>

<p>After a nice long weekend, things have been pretty busy at work in preparation for me starting a new position in a few weeks. I unfortunately got behind on some monotonous tasks while we were out of the office due to Covid, so I‚Äôve been playing catchup with filing and such. I‚Äôm also managing a project that is transitioning a very offline bureaucratic process into an online format. It‚Äôs unfortunate that I won‚Äôt be able to test out the system in real life, but I feel good about leading this project and hopefully providing a good tool for whoever takes my job after I‚Äôm gone.¬†</p>
<p>I heard from my new boss today. He and the director would like to get coffee with me next week as an informal way to get to know each other better and talk more about the position. I‚Äôm looking forward to it, and excited but nervous about the new direction my career is taking.¬†</p>

			 <p>You ever look in the mirror and wonder, ‚Äúwho the hell is that?‚Äù Seems every day my beard gets a little grayer, my skin a little worse, my body a little more exhausted. I‚Äôm trying to age gracefully but the thought of death has been living rent free in my mind since my younger brother passed two years ago and the signs of time passing don‚Äôt provide much comfort.</p>
<p>To be fair, things have been better the last few months. I‚Äôm getting good sleep, waking up earlier, showing up in all aspects of my life. In a lot of ways, I feel on top of things, and have a lot that is going well for me. I think I‚Äôm a pretty good dad most days, I try to be a good husband, I‚Äôve made a good home for my family, I‚Äôm making advances in my career.¬†</p>
<p>Still, I have lost a lot of myself since becoming a father a little over 4 years ago. My life is so focused on others that it‚Äôs hard to ignore that I often don‚Äôt recognize myself anymore, not just physically but also in spirit. I am no longer a naive young man with too much to say, I‚Äôm a middle aged guy unsure that he has anything to say at all.</p>
<p>I know that this is just part of parenthood and that things will never be the same. I also know that I‚Äôm in the thickest, deepest part of these woods just given my two kids‚Äô ages. I don‚Äôt take for granted that they will never be this age again. I really do try to pour myself into this life and enjoy it at the same time. I‚Äôm happy nearly every single day. I find moments of peace and pleasure in small things. I don‚Äôt wish this time away for anything.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I just wish we had a little more help. I just know that I need to block out more intentional time for myself.¬†</p>

			 <p>My wife and I are watching Fleishman Is in Trouble on Hulu and I‚Äôm really impressed by the writing. No real spoilers here, but I do talk about some basic plot info and some experiences of a supporting actor if you want to skip reading this.</p>
<p>The main character of the show is Toby Fleishman, a recently divorced middle aged hematologist. His successful ex-wife, a New York City talent rep for performing artists, just disappears one day and doesn‚Äôt come back, leaving him and his preteen kids in the dark about her whereabouts. He and his kids are in shock and struggle to make their way in a new life without her.</p>
<p>Although Fleishman‚Äôs experience is the main plot arc, we also learn about the various struggles his friends are experiencing in mid life.</p>
<p>One of his best friends is Libby, and I find her character especially relatable. Her character is about my age in real life, has been married to a lawyer for a long time, and is having a difficult time getting the recognition she deserves as a female writer at a men‚Äôs magazine. She watches as male writers get promoted as she‚Äôs passed over.</p>
<p>On the episode we watched last night (S1 E6), Libby was out at a once-a-year party with old friends whom she knew from studying abroad in Israel in college. She‚Äôs drinking and having a great time, but as the night turns late, her husband begins to get snippy with her about wanting to leave. She insists on staying while the husband storms off.</p>
<p>As she gets more drunk, her feelings about life start to overwhelm her on how dull life becomes in middle age.</p>
<p>She begins to realize how good her life was when she was young, about things she took for granted. In her search for success and carving out an adult life, she somehow missed that she had so much power in her freedom, which she things she let go of too readily in exchange for stability and security. Now the spice of life has left and all she longs for are the unknowns, the freedom of figuring it all out. </p></p>
<p>Personally I‚Äôve been feeling some similar things, although not as deeply. I love the life I‚Äôve created, but there certainly is some personal growth involved in settling into life while also trying to meet some of those core needs and desires we all tend to put aside when starting a family and getting on with a career.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a struggle to figure out which needs and desires are reasonable when you have to make sacrifices. That can be a tricky negotiation, one that I‚Äôm still figuring out and will likely continue to figure out forever. In my heart I know it‚Äôs necessary to carve out some life for myself on this never ending path toward self-actualization. It‚Äôs the guilt that can come with that negotiation that can be so difficult to get over.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in store for Libby‚Äôs character, but it‚Äôs comforting just seeing characters in my life stage, at this moment in history, working through similar feelings. In a way, it affirms my feelings that I should be giving myself permission to feel what I feel and explore who I am instead of letting guilt force my hand.</p>

			 <p>One of the occupational hazards of being an urban planner is that you‚Äôre constantly being critical of the built environment around you. </p>
<p>While out and about, all I think about is access management plans, lack of pedestrian and bicycle facilities, crappy or non-existent transit facilities, single-use buildings in multi-use zones, disappointment in the lack of residential density, Americans‚Äô distaste for residential density, unchecked code violations in wealthy neighborhoods, low quality building materials, huge parking lots, impervious surfaces and flood plains, crappy landscaping, HOAs and restrictive covenants, unsafe routes to school, lack of healthy food options, poor parks and other green spaces, NIMBYs, and on and on. </p>
<p>Sometimes I wish I would‚Äôve gone into something a little more micro, like landscaping or plumbing.</p>

			 <p>Thinking back to my first sociology class at University of Michigan in 1999. It was a social stratification lecture and my professor asked every single student on the first day what suburb of Detroit we lived in, and he proceeded to rank our social status based on that. Of course it played into the subject matter, but what a wild experience that stuck with each of us the remainder of the semester. Felt real bad for the girl from Melvindale. <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/umich" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>umich</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/socialscience" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>socialscience</span></a> <a href="https://mastodon.social/tags/sociology" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>sociology</span></a></p>

			 <p>It was what feels like a lifetime ago, but I still have some lingering trauma left over from my teenage years when my mom married my stepdad. I know she didn‚Äôt mean to do any harm and was in fact trying to do something positive for herself and her kids.</p>
<p>She moved me and my brothers out of the city and into the country. It wasn‚Äôt cross-country or anything, but it was still far enough away to lose all of my existing friends and to feel very isolated. We were also unable to walk anywhere given the location. Basically the middle of nowhere. Tough on a city kid who was used to running around the neighborhood everyday until the street lights came on.</p>
<p>I was also bullied for being quiet and different back then. And looking back, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that a lot of that had to do with politics that I was too young to fully understand. Even looking at my report cards, I definitely think I was treated differently coming from a more liberal family. I even remember our physical sciences teacher telling us that radio carbon dating was a hoax and that God put dinosaur bones in the ground to trick us, but the world was much younger. Imagine having such a twisted worldview and proselytizing about it to children.</p>
<p>My wife didn‚Äôt fully get it until she visited my parents with me this past year. She used to roll her eyes at me. Thought I was being dramatic. But she could barely handle being there a week before she went crazy. I woke up one morning to her walking up and down my parents‚Äô 200 meter driveway with the baby because the road is a county collector, too busy with with fast cars coming and going between cities. Lots of blind curves and no sidewalks. Besides, nowhere in which to walk.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I like being outdoors and visiting rural areas. I even daydream sometimes about having more space, especially since the houses are larger and more affordable the farther you go out. But I don‚Äôt think I could ever do it permanently, especially to my kids.</p>
<p>Now that I live in a larger metro area, the conveniences are many, but more than anything I think it‚Äôs about being surrounded by people with similar values. There‚Äôs a lot of diversity in our area, education is important, and there are good jobs and opportunity. Say what you will about how the right and left should talk more, try to understand one another, but I had a really hard time with oppressive rural attitudes and I would die inside if my kids ever had to live through anything similar.</p>

I also acknowledge my privilege as a white middle class household with relatively stable employment. I feel so heartbroken for those who don√¢¬Ä¬ôt, and if there√¢¬Ä¬ôs a way I can help, please let me know. I wish everyone a healthy and prosperous 2021, preferably at least once consuming delicious food and beverages INSIDE a really nice restaurant.</p>

			 <p>I just started watching Long Way Up the other night, an electric motorcycle journey from the tip of South America, up to LA, with Ewan McGregor. Someone mentioned that not everyone watched Evel Knievel jumping the Grand Canyon to see him make it√¢¬Ä¬îsome watched it to see if he WOULDN√¢¬Ä¬ôT. I stopped the episode and YouTubed Evel and fell into a hole. I never knew the guy was such a character. Highly recommended if you√¢¬Ä¬ôre up sick and need something strange but interesting to watch.</p>

			 <p>Love these two, and I√¢¬Ä¬ôm feeling especially appreciative and lucky to have such a wonderful partner to help navigate this life. Pax√¢¬Ä¬ôs face in this photo cracks me up. We got out to the Jenkins Estate and enjoyed Monday evening in the gardens and letting Pax run around like a fool in the grassy open areas. Most of the Rhodies were past their prime, but a few were still looking good. My favorite part was slowly looking around all the community garden plots and what people were doing with theirs. I took some notes. I think we√¢¬Ä¬ôll all be happy when this virus business is over and we can feel safer going out more often (and maybe having a beer or two on a patio somewhere - Oregon isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt the same without that).</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Came home from Idaho yesterday and realized when we arrived that Google Street View of our house had been updated. Yeah!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was always sad to see its previous state on Google Maps when I‚Äôd get home. The picture at bottom was right before I bought it, when it was going into foreclosure 3 years ago. I was almost hesitant to put our return address on Christmas cards sometimes lest someone looked us up and thought we lived in a meth house. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I bought the house because I could afford it on one income and knew I could make it work seeing as it was structurally fine and is within walking distance to the train. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We‚Äôve since put a little love into it. Most notably, I painted the outside last year (what a job). We‚Äôve got quite a bit more to go, but it has come a long way. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the upcoming house projects is a combination of new gutters and an 1100-gallon rain cistern for the garden and hopefully new landscaping. I applied for a grant a few months back and the agency providing the fund is coming over to do a site visit next week.

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the things that I wasn‚Äôt prepared for in midlife is how difficult it would be to adjust to life without a passion. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This isn‚Äôt to say that I have never had passion. It‚Äôs just that the time commitment involved in nurturing a passion is severely diminished. Work, commute, house, 5-month-old baby ‚Äî it‚Äôs seems so cliche, but finding the time for yourself really is difficult. And when you try to fit it in with any level of regularity, something else usually suffers. But does it have to? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I‚Äôve been playing guitar since I was 14 years old. I never took lessons, but when you‚Äôre alone or unemployed or broke or all of the above, you‚Äôve got a lot of time on your hands to noodle around and nurture it. What I lacked in knowledge, I made up in pure creativity. I‚Äôm not saying I was some sort of guitar god - that would be douchy as hell. But I loved playing so much and it was an escape from sometimes difficult reality. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fast forward almost 25 years and I‚Äôve been trying to get back into it. For too many years, my guitar collected dust. I‚Äôd pick it up now and again, and it was sort of like riding a bike. But there‚Äôs a big difference between taking a leisurely roll around the neighborhood and competing in a triathlon with it. Dedication, education, persistence, passion - you have to want it. And even then, when you‚Äôre a cyclist, rarely do people ask you to perform for them on the spot. There‚Äôs an implied prerequisite to share your passion with others through performance when it comes to music, even when you treat it as something personal. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Playing guitar for me still is a meditation, but it was more on the leisurely roll side of things. I had fun, sang some tunes around the house, and blacked out the work day stress or nonstop baby puke. However, I‚Äôd been feeling like my life was missing an opportunity for growth and to get me out of my shell. . </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I started taking lessons for the first time a couple of months ago. I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd like it, but it‚Äôs been incredible. It‚Äôs every other week, so not a huge commitment, but I already find myself getting to a level I‚Äôve never reached before. I‚Äôm still rusty as hell, but it‚Äôs nice to be challenged in a way that is not in the form of a traditional education, or work or family related. It also gives me some much needed time to myself. I missed that. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All these years I feel like I‚Äôve been coloring with 3 crayons. Learning the fretboard and scales (however slowly) is opening the palette up and making the creative process easier. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I‚Äôve also made a friend in the neighborhood and we‚Äôre getting together for the first time tomorrow night to play acoustic guitar. I haven‚Äôt had a friend to play music with regularly in years and I‚Äôm actually pretty excited about it. I‚Äôm even more excited to have someone in my neighborhood instead of making the trek into Portland all the time. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At any rate, my goal by taking lessons and playing with others is to get better at improvisation and to become a better music writer. I harbor no illusions (or desires) to play regular gigs or becoming known in any way. But I would like to finally start making and recording music and honoring that part of myself that I‚Äôve neglected as other parts of me grew. I‚Äôm setting that intention now and I‚Äôll revisit this post in the coming years to see how I‚Äôve done. Who knows, maybe I‚Äôll even post something here someday. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today my son is three months old. As expected, it‚Äôs been a busy and amazing time. My life is changed forever and in all the best ways. Life is more inwardly focused with less a feeling of rudderlessness. It‚Äôs simultaneously simpler yet more complicated. </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For me and many others, the idea of parenthood before becoming a parent is often shrouded in in fear. Fear that a part of your life will come to an end because of the responsibilities and time commitments that come with becoming a parent. But then you become a parent and, for me, the perspective completely flips.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I had to pick one word that best describes the human experience, it would be <em>adaptation</em>. To me it‚Äôs the human condition. Our greatest strength and our greatest source of suffering. </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All the brilliant works of art and feats of engineering were the result of the incomparable human ability to adapt. And yet that feeling of dullness that can often take over our once novel feelings about some aspect of life is also caused by adaptation. Boredom is adaptation. Depression can be a symptom of adaptation.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can desire change in our lives and seek it out, through hard work and focus. We can be driven toward a goal by passion. And it‚Äôs an awesome thing to achieve something you‚Äôve set out to do. Sometimes change is thrust upon us and the pangs of anxiety can be so overwhelming that you feel as though you‚Äôre 100 feet underwater and can‚Äôt breathe. But all our new experiences become the new normal in time. </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that, as an idea and a mindset, parenthood is my new normal. I am no longer fearful of the idea or the reality of parenthood. But the beautiful thing so far is that with every passing day, it‚Äôs different. My son changes every day, in big and small ways, and I get to help grow him into a person while simultaneously being filled with purpose.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are tough times, and there will be so many more. But they pale in comparison to the good. </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And unlike the sometimes unhealthy human need for change for the sake of itself, having <em>this</em> purpose nourishes my human need to move forward and adapt without‚Äîpardon the expression‚Äîthrowing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are so many things I could have said in this first post as a parent, but it is just <em>too</em> <em>big</em> now. All I can say is that having my son has been an enormously additive experience to life and I just can‚Äôt imagine having never experienced it. </p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Love,</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dad</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Baby still isn‚Äôt here. Just got back from a check-up and some grocery shopping. Shar‚Äôs about to partake in some reality TV, so I‚Äôm contemplating other things. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yesterday was a really good day. We started out with breakfast from Black Bear Diner. Much better than driving into Portland, waiting forever for a seat, having so-so food, and then paying out the ass. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Shar surprised me by taking me for my first ever full-service pedicure. It was‚Ä¶incredible. Of course I didn‚Äôt get any color done, but they pull out all the stops. Massage chair, foot soak, foot scrub, foot and leg massage, hot wax, toe nail clean up. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like it and I just might have to do it a couple times a year for relaxation. </p>

I took the day to give the office a thorough cleaning. The office is also my music room and also our spare room now that the spare room has become the nursery. Things are tight in here already, but I rearranged my guitar pedal board last week and all the cut up velcro and patch cables really put things in rough shape. Much better now.  Still have to get these cords in order, however. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôm not 100% sure how or when it all got started, but for the longest time I just wanted to be seen as one of the ‚Äúcool kids.‚Äù I wanted to be accepted by the ‚Äúcool kids.‚Äù</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I can speculate that it probably began late in elementary school. My brothers and I grew up poor but adjacent to wealthier people. We didn't go without, but I was consistently surrounded by kids who had everything they wanted and more.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For the first part of my childhood, I also grew up without a father around. I think this contributed to my lack of confidence and knowledge about masculine things. I grew up knowing almost nothing about sports or cars or other things many men use to connect.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To top it off, I have always been really quiet. This made me a target for bullying from the loud and more confident kids. My quietness and lack of confidence in myself made me not cool in the eyes of the ones I thought I wanted to be like.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sadly, I think I internalized this feeling of being an outsider and channeled in negative ways. Some positive things too, like introspective hobbies like music and writing, but also negative habits like consistently comparing myself, what I have, what I have accomplished, and my tastes, to others. And although I‚Äôm aware of it and want to change it, I haven‚Äôt yet. I‚Äôm beginning to, but I haven‚Äôt gotten over the hump.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I find myself ever striving for more and focusing on material things. Not luxury cars, but quality things around the house. I get down on myself about the way my house looks and want to spend money to improve it (I bought it as a fixer up in the white hot Portland market back in 2016). I compare my neighborhood to others‚Äô. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But I think I‚Äòm starting to feel more of a letting go of these feelings and fake needs as I get older. I find myself not interested in a lot fo the things I used to be interested in even a few years ago, favoring time spent in at night enjoying quiet introverted things like playing music or reading articles on the internet on random topics I‚Äôm interested in.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôm accepting myself more for who I am and what my strengths are versus a superficial quality of coolness or acceptance by others. And it‚Äôs pretty freeing. I am actually growing less and less interested in people in general, with the exception of those closest to me, and it feels great. Strange, perhaps. But I don‚Äôt feel anything unhealthy about it. I feel like my season of life is changing and that I‚Äôm <em>actually</em> ok with things slowing down to more of an internal focus. I‚Äôm focusing less on accomplishments and ownership and more on an internal exploration of my purpose in life.&nbsp;</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I may not know who the cool bands are anymore and I still might not be able to chat up the boss about sports. I might be looked over for that promotion. But I‚Äôm becoming perfectly content with my quiet little life and worrying less and less about measuring it against those of others. &nbsp;</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At any rate, I‚Äôve had a lot of thoughts lately that I‚Äôve wanted to write about, but whenever I try to figure out a way to put them into words, I have a lot of trouble. So maybe I‚Äôve been over thinking them and I should just keep them simple. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We are now less than 2 weeks out from our baby‚Äôs due date. In the last couple of weeks, we‚Äôve had two sets of friends have their babies and that has helped to make things more real. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I mean, it‚Äôs really just a construct for us guys until the little person is out anyway, right? We‚Äôre not the ones going through all of it. We‚Äôre not feeling it inside ourselves. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And I guess the thing that is smacking me in the face is that this little human will be half of me. That is so banal that I almost passed out from boredom typing it. But that is really what I am gobsmacked about. That a person whom I love very much who is sitting in the other room is carrying a living being that is half me and half her. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This probably happens to everybody, but maybe I‚Äôm feeling it amplified because it‚Äôs been so difficult in seeing my own father in me given that he wasn‚Äôt in my life. It‚Äôs as though I‚Äôve viewed myself as the child of my mother via asexual reproduction. Any lack of resemblance was merely a mutation or due to some environmental factor. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So today when I got home from work I found Shar lying on the bed in our room, exhausted from the day. She‚Äôs been a real trouper, working up until her due date and taking barre classes and such. So I crawl into bed with her and start rubbing her belly and I can feel this child‚Äôs outline. I can feel its bottom and along the side of its leg. I mean, it‚Äôs not too distinct, but you can sort of tell that this isn‚Äôt just a belly with a weird notch in it. And I‚Äôm just sitting in the relative quiet that is my life, the relative lack of responsibility for anything more than our dog, and realize. I just realize the reality. It‚Äôs slowly been creeping up on me, but it‚Äôs gonna hit me so hard when the little he or she is actually here.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I know, it‚Äôs dumb. But that‚Äôs how I feel right now. Dumb. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The other thing that has been sitting in the back of my mind is the hope that I‚Äôm not a failure. Throughout this pregnancy, everybody offers unsolicited advice. I know most mean well, but it can really shake you up if you let it. And it got me thinking about what if I‚Äôm not a great parent? All my life I‚Äôve thought about how my father wasn‚Äôt there for me and that I‚Äôd be this wonderful father in spite of that. But what if I‚Äôm NOT? I know my shortcomings in life and I know the dreams I have in my head that I sometimes accomplish and sometimes don‚Äôt. I think of the goals I have and the ones I‚Äôve gone after and the ones that collect dust. I guess I just hope I can provide the type of environment that my child or children can thrive. And that they not only love me but they like me and are proud of me someday. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôm also thinking about my own life and my own risks in different ways. I‚Äôm thinking about safety and security and looking both ways when I cross through a busy intersection. I peed at the urinal today and thought about saving for the future and life insurance and college. There‚Äôs been a lot of thoughts in this head. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The past few weekends, Shar and I have been sort of go-go-go. I felt a bit of panic that the house wasn‚Äôt looking that great and that we don‚Äôt have as much as so-and-so or that our house isn‚Äôt as nice as this-and-that. And in my way of anxiety, I took it out on Shar. I tend to compare and I really am trying to work on that, but there was no excuse to act mean to her especially at this time. We got through it, but I need to recognize that I need to recognize my feelings for what they are, accept them, and either do something to change it myself or express them and ask for help. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And it was so silly. About making our house a home and just wanting more help in making it look like a home. In the same ways Shar needs help around the house with logistical things. I guess I focus more on the art of it while she‚Äôs more practical in a lot of ways. I think we‚Äôll rub off on each other through time.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, I know my time is about to be eaten up to a great degree. I‚Äôm taking a month off when the baby is born and I‚Äôm so grateful I get to do that, but I know once they‚Äôre here that some things will be put on pause. Perhaps this writing, perhaps my playing music almost every night. Maybe our lazy nights on the couch. I guess I can‚Äôt really fathom how it‚Äôs going to be at the moment. Hell, the next time I write, I could very well have a baby and 2019 is halfway done. But  I hope I can retain a bit of myself along the way. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This feels like it‚Äôs been one big ramble, but I‚Äôm just so filled with a deep well of love and gratitude that I‚Äôm here right now and able to experience this. At least until I‚Äôm running on no sleep and elbow deep in shitty diapers. Until next time. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So the new year came without much fanfare. 2019, here we are. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We spent the evening in bed, and dare I say it was probably one of the best NYE‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever had? I‚Äôm not sure Shar can say the same, but I‚Äôve almost always disappointed by NYE parties.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For starters, I get too nostalgic. Second, I hate crowds. And third, they‚Äôre just sad to me for some reason. Here we are! It‚Äôs another year! Let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre gonna change on purpose on this arbitrary moment in space but not really do it! That‚Äôs why I start my new habits regularly. I keep a running tally of how long I‚Äôve been doing each to motivate me and to not break the habit. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So, we spent our NYE joyously in our luxurious double pillow top/memory foam king size bed reading, without any real intentions for the new year other than to continue to try and be our best. We leaned over and kissed each other at midnight, turned off the light, and fell asleep. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I also woke up sober and feeling alive. My skin had color to it and I smiled a lot, perhaps for the first since legally able to drink. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I ran 3 day this week. Yesterday I did 3 miles and ran a personal record at age 37, which is still a depressingly slow 10 minute something split. However, I‚Äôm trending in the right direction. I took today off because I sort of hurt my leg yesterday and wanted to give it a day to rest. Plus, I really don‚Äôt think the running 5 days a week thing is good for our joints. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I have still not lost any weight despite burning about 500 extra calories per day and giving up a lot of not-so-great foods. Not sure what is up there but I can only think it‚Äôs at least partially attributed to the vegetarian diet. I see folks doing keto losing tons of weight and it‚Äôs sort of frustrating given what I thought I was doing when I began this journey. At least I‚Äôm still not gaining. But I might have to rethink this thing. I‚Äôm working on 11 months without a piece of animal flesh in my digestive system and I‚Äôm rather enjoying it, but I‚Äôd really love to lose about 30 pounds. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My last update was about wearing the holter monitor after 3 months of trying to get one from Kaiser Permanente. They shaved my chest and glued the thing on. I dropped it off on New Year‚Äôs Day. Still no word. I‚Äôm coming to expect this. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The baby‚Äôs due two weeks from Saturday. I keep thinking I‚Äôm gonna get an excited call from Shar telling me things are happening. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ever been more ready to be a mother in her life. Me, I‚Äôm a little nervous but also very excited. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Two nights ago it moved a lot in her belly and I caught a little bit of it on video. Kind of alien-like! Can‚Äôt wait to meet him or her!</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I finally complained to Kaiser Permanente that I was going to switch insurance providers if they didn‚Äôt get me in for a holter moniter. It had been three months since my doctor requested one for me and I was getting pretty upset. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thursday KP called me to setup an appointment for the next day to get fitted for one. The lady was apologetic, and I kept my cool, but I really wanted to be an asshole. Even if this turns out to be nothing, no one should have to wait 3 months for something so simple when you have a family history of heart problems. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anyway, my heart has only done its flutter twice since I‚Äôve been wearing this thing, so hopefully they can get a read on it and tell me what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm wearing it it until 4:00 today. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My grandfather, whom I met only once, had a condition called an bicuspid aortic valve and died in his 60s. I learned this from my half uncle, whom also has the condition and had heart surgery in his 40s. I may not have it. My recent EKG came back normal, but they only monitored for about a minute. This bicuspid aortic valve is like a an occasional hard push in the heart. I‚Äôm not sure if what I‚Äôm experiencing is the same thing. But the combo had me scared and wanting to know. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Prior to figuring out my family history, I thought maybe it had something to do with my smoking or eating too much shit food. But I just hit the two year mark since I last had a cigarette and I‚Äôm working on a year since I‚Äôve had meat. My cholesterol was way down 6 months after quitting the stuff. And I kept having the heart flutter. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Maybe this isn‚Äôt a big deal. But I guess I know my body and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm used to experiencing. Things happen as we age, but it still seems strange. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In other news, Melissa started having contractions for her baby yesterday and she‚Äôs in the hospital. I guess after hours she is still being induced. I‚Äôm not sure of the details, but I hope all is well with her and her son. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll learn more soon enough from her and Natasha. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I drove to work yesterday for the first time in a couple of months since I needed to go to the hospital yesterday. I went to Ross and got some new underwear, which I‚Äôm strangely excited about. I also think driving sucks now. Traffic was super frustrating on lunch and after work and I can tell it has a major impact on my mental attitude. Even though I got my car fixed, I‚Äôm still taking the train to work (I did every day but Friday this week). </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The weather has been consistently a little more wet, but not terrible for this time of year. The cloud breaks are still common, we haven‚Äôt got any snow, and we only had a couple of days of frost. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Zoey is sitting on the bed behind me and has brought multiple toys to me to get my attention. She really wants to play. I probably should give her some exercise. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Making room in my life for the important stuff has never been easy for me. I am probably the most nostalgic person I‚Äôve ever known in real life and letting go of that is pretty tough. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôll get lost in old notebooks or saved greeting cards for hours. I often think about people from my past. I think about my successes and my mistakes, of which there are many of both. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But the older I get, the more respect I have for myself, too. I have higher expectations of the company I choose to keep because I ain‚Äôt got the time or the energy for anything else. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My Instagram feed will not be filled with photos of me in large groups of people in interesting social situations. No, I have few friends, but the ones I keep around I truly value and I think they value me. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôve got a quirky personality, I am often quiet, and I can be awkward. A lot of people don‚Äôt know how to work with that or accept that. But the people I keep around work through that and allow me to be me, and that has become center stage in my awareness of good people. They stick out like sore thumbs, the ones who try and listen and smile and ask questions. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I don‚Äôt have the time or the space for superficial interactions, for political drama or thinly veiled insecurities on social media, for people who chatter. I‚Äôve found the down-to-earth people, the lovers, the encouragers, the listeners, and I ain‚Äôt got no time for the holier-than-thou‚Äôs. And damn if it doesn‚Äôt feel good to respect myself enough to make  space for the real ones.</p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It‚Äôs been a sort of weird adjusting expectations with a baby on the way and not being ‚Äúhome‚Äù for the holidays. Christmases were always such a big deal in our house. Tree, decorations, lots of gifts. My mom still tries to buy us all a bunch of gifts and I‚Äôm pushing 40. But with the baby coming next month, budgeting takes precedence. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And to be honest, Shar and I had some disagreements over this. I am definitely less frugal than her, and I got upset. No one ever said marriage was easy, and compromise we sometimes do. I‚Äôm working on it. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I grew up living at my grandmother‚Äôs house for a number of years. It was a tiny little 3-bedroom place in Saginaw, Michigan. I had 6 aunts and uncles and a lot of them had kids as well and we‚Äôd all cram into that house and the presents would be stacked halfway to the ceiling it seemed. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">My grandmother, who lived on social security only, would save up for half the year just to make sure each of her dozen or so grandkids would have something from her to open on Christmas morning. She had a budget of $25 or so for each kid. I know that was a lot of money for her, but it was important to her. I think that must have stuck with me because I still view Christmas as a really big deal, even when money is tight. Not in the sense that I think mindless consumerism is important. But just that it‚Äôs the time to splurge a little and show the people you love that you‚Äôve been thinking of them.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Here in Oregon, it‚Äôs still a little strange adjusting to the moderate temps and general lack of snow in these parts of the world this time of year. At that same grandma‚Äôs house, she used to cover her crappy windows in clear plastic to keep the chill out of the rooms. I can still remember her standing on a chair and using a blow dryer to heat and stretch the plastic until it fit snugly. I‚Äôd often wake up as a kid and sit over a heater vent on the ground, pulling my shirt over my knees and trapping all the heat into it. But I ain‚Äôt complainin‚Äô about the weather in the PNW. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This year, we spent Christmas Eve in La Center with Shar‚Äôs mom and step family. Big full house with lots of kids. It was fun.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After opening up gifts for our own wee little Christmas yesterday, Shar and I went up to Hagg Lake and walked a trail. Zoey stomped around in the mud a bit yesterday and we could tell she had a really good time running around and sniffing everything that she could. She snagged a few dozen burs in her Velcro fur and got mud all over. A glob of mud got on her eyelash and basically cemented it shut. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At one point, Zoey jumped a small creek to retrieve a stick (we threw over) and she had a hard time convincing herself that she could get back to us. It was kind of cute as she whined like a puppy, but we eventually got her back. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Back at the house, the dog got a bath and some scissors to the fir. I fiddled with the washing machine that has been giving us problems and Shar whipped up a real nice Christmas dinner (I‚Äôm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today). After dinner, we all snuggled up on the couch and rented a movie before calling it a night. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today I celebrate 2 years since I had my last cigarette. I remember smoking my last one the day after Christmas in 2016 and hopping a plane back to Portland before we went off to San Diego for New Years‚Äô Eve. I was so tired of the control it had over me. It goes without saying, but this was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made. To say nothing about the health benefits, I‚Äôm saving at least $2500 per year. Can‚Äôt believe how much went up in smoke over the years, but happy to report I‚Äôm still going strong and not looking back. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">This morning on the train we had to get off at Quatama Station because there was some sort of accident at Orenco. As we all shuffled out of the train and onto shuttles, I was annoyed. I‚Äôve been riding the train for a few months now and I was going to be late for work again because of it.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As we departed by bus, I fired up Twitter for the scoop. It turns out that a train hit a pedestrian and they were avoiding Quatama while police investigated the incident.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Someone lost their life too soon today. And their loved ones are grieving the loss with some immense amount of pain that lacks any meaning. And somewhere a train operator killed someone and is likely dealing with their own pain and grief.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So even though I was 45 minutes late for work, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything. It‚Äôs not worth it to hold a negative thought. Hug your loved ones and live your life with happiness in your heart.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In some positive news, my mom finished her last round of chemo today after starting a few months ago after her  double mastectomy. I know it‚Äôs been scary for her, and I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôll be on the mend now. It was scary for us all, and we‚Äôre all thankful for her catching it early and for the good prognosis. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All 5 of us piled back into Tim‚Äôs Jeep to check out Urban Fondue. Not a place setup for vegetarians and sharing, so I was sort of disappointed, but I got something I could eat, ate some cheese, bread, and a beat salad, and a little bit of dessert. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The night was going well, but the girls and their mom got into a bit of an argument at the end, so things got tense there for a minute. Shar‚Äôs sister is in town form San Diego so I don‚Äôt think it was her idea of a good use of her time. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">They dropped me off at the train at Goode Hollow so I could high-tail it home. They argued more on their way back to the in laws‚Äô house, but I guess they all smoothed it over today. Something about past relationships, too much drink in the system, etc. Something something about our baby-to-be. I don‚Äôt really care, just glad it‚Äôs all back to normal. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So I had the house to myself and honestly I fell asleep really early (for me, that‚Äôs 10:00). I slept on my back wrong at the in laws‚Äô and I needed to just not think about the pain and not move. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Went to the gym today on lunch. Didn‚Äôt eat much, so I swung by a Lebanese place at the Orenco stop on the way home. First time there. Not too bad. Saved enough of my falafel wrap for lunch tomorrow.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">On my way back to the train, I saw that a new brewery is opening up called Manama Brewing Co. I guess they‚Äôre out of Corvallis, and I‚Äôm super excited that they‚Äôll be there even though I know nothing about them. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I did 5 miles today on my lunch hour. I can tell I‚Äôm going to hurt a bit tomorrow, but hell if it didn‚Äôt feel great! I am debating if I should get up early tomorrow and ride the opposite direction of my meeting in Portland to do my weight day. It will make for a long one, but I hate it that I‚Äôd otherwise have to miss. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Anyway, Shar and I had a bit of a discussion about my airline miles credit card. I paid for my flight (Thanksgiving week no less) with my Delta card because I had accumulated 70,000 miles. Sort of stupid since I was saving up for a trip to Europe, but with the baby coming along, I really didn‚Äôt want to spend $700 on a flight to Michigan in November. Anyway, that‚Äôs besides the point. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The reason I had 70,000 miles on my credit card is because I spent $70,000 on my credit card. That alone should give me pause. Sure, it was over the course of a year and a half, but still. I pay it off every month, but it‚Äôs one of those things where I didn‚Äôt really think too much about whether or not I had the money to spend because it wasn‚Äôt coming out of my checking account right at that moment. So, I spent more than I should have, consistently. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So I‚Äôve switched over to using my debit card, which in and of itself is enough to curb the spending. When you see your checking account balance, the internal debate is a lot stronger as to whether or not you need a specific item. Most often, the answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô. Anyway, I think I‚Äôm reigning it in and the spending habit is being curbed. Besides, if you just saved the annual fee you spend on those things, you‚Äôre halfway to a ticket right there.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And traveling is something we want to do. Where, no one knows. Neither of us have traveled with a baby before, so that will be freaky. But I know we both need it. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As for work, things are going fine. I just passed my 1 year anniversary in the new role and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the change. It‚Äôs sort of strange being slightly lower on the totem pole, but sometimes you have to take a step back to move ahead, and my happiness and fulfillment are pretty high even if I‚Äôm not getting rich anytime soon. Of course the benefits don‚Äôt hurt - we did the math the other day and it‚Äôs going to cost about $600 out-of-pocket to have the baby. Not too shabby if you ask me. Things are cruising. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The interesting and difficult thing will be doing the math early next year. I think a lot of people are going to be shocked when they do their taxes with the changes made to the tax code since Trump took office. Let‚Äôs just say I hope you increased your withholdings if you‚Äôre the type of person who likes to get money back. Your vacation may be a staycation. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And since it will be the first year Shar and I can choose to do our taxes jointly or apart, that adds another element of difficult. Mostly because both of our student loan payments are based on income. So if we file together, our income is higher, and our payments could potentially go up. We‚Äôre both on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) train and I‚Äôm about halfway done with it before the remainder is forgiven. In this situation you want to pay as little as possible. So we may file separately despite the implications for our taxes. I may post a spreadsheet here once I get it figured out just in case anyone else is in a similar boat. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At any rate, I‚Äôve got the house to myself tonight so it‚Äôs time to go hit some strings on my guitar. Nighty night. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As I mentioned briefly in a previous post, I‚Äôve been going to the gym every day on my lunch hour. With the exception of Thanksgiving week when I went to Michigan to visit family, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve been going every day for at least 7 weeks, with a week or two before that when I went 3 days a week. A couple months doesn‚Äôt sound like much‚Äîand really, it isn‚Äôt‚Äîbut I feel like I‚Äôve built a habit and now I can‚Äôt wait to go to the gym. I never thought it‚Äôd be me. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Although I haven‚Äôt seen any change at all in my weight, I‚Äôm feeling a lot different and my body feels leaner and more tone.  I feel like my muscles work now, and every movement I make becomes more apparent. I can feel my core and my thighs and my arm muscles and it gives me more confidence. Sometimes even the slight pain caused by a good weight session feels good. Honestly thought, I don‚Äôt hurt a whole lot. I‚Äôm wondering if it has something to do with my vegetarian diet. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I began with 3 days of cardio and 2 days of weights, but with all of the reading I‚Äôve been doing, it sounds like weight training might be where it‚Äôs at. Now I do weight training 3 days a week and 2 days of cardio. So if I get any excercise at all on the weekend, like with a walk or a hike, I‚Äôm getting three of each. It‚Äôs a lot more likely I‚Äôm going to get in a passive cardio day on the weekend anyway. Walking to the train everyday helps me get in some steps as well. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I started with really intense cardio sessions. Like trying to run long distances on the treadmill. But after reading a book by Rich Roll, an Ultra Man, I‚Äôve switched to heart rate targeting for weight loss, even if that means quickly walking for an hour. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôm taking it easy on the weights, for the most part. It‚Äôs been over a decade since I‚Äôve done any sort of weight training and the last thing I want to do is injure myself and set myself back. But I think I‚Äôm getting to the point where I don‚Äôt feel like a total weakling and I can start lifting heavier. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As I said earlier, my body rarely hurts anymore from lifting with the exception of squats. Before this month, I don‚Äôt recall ever doing a squat in my life. I have some chicken ass legs and I‚Äôd like to change that, especially after injuring my quads in winter kickball the last 2 years straight. I figure it‚Äôs time to get these things into shape. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôm gradually seeing my body change, but the quickest changes have been in my attitude and mental health. Honestly, I‚Äôm just a whole lot more happy. Every day I just feel happy and peaceful. I sleep better. I‚Äôm more content. It‚Äôs like all of those years as a hyper-caffeinated smoker with anxiety are washing away. Those days where I felt like a worthless punk with no motivation - I can see those attributes slipping away. And I like the way it feels. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I spent the weekend doing nothing an onlooker would find spectacular, but it was altogether exactly what I needed. It seems like the go-go-go sometimes needs a break, and that‚Äôs what we did. At least in the sense that we weren‚Äôt off to somewhere or something for a change.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I cleaned out my closet. Yep, dug down to the bottom of things. All of the stuff that doesn‚Äôt make me feel great to wear, or my belly has outgrown them. Lots of 34 size pants. A few medium shirts. We filled up a donation basket and brought it to the second hand store. It feels good to have some space cleared away, and hopefully someone else can find them useful. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We thought about getting a Christmas tree this year - a large one, but decided against the expense - we‚Äôll look for sales after the holiday. This year we‚Äôll use the little 3-footer Shar got from the dollar store a few years back. One of my favorite and least favorite things about Shar is how notoriously cheap she is. She may reform me yet.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">We took some holiday photos with the dog. I immediately thought about those DINKs who take photos with their dog. Yeah, I guess we are those people. But so the fuck what. We love our dog. Here it is:</p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last night we relaxed on the couch and watched the movie Crazy Rich Asians. Shar wasn‚Äôt very excited about it because she‚Äôs not into RomComs, but she actually ended up liking it more than I did. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I was telling her last night how nice it has been settling into our life together. I couldn‚Äôt have been more grateful sitting there sinking into the couch with both of my girls at my sides. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For the last several years, I‚Äôve had a bit of a heart‚Ä¶flutter. It‚Äôs not a painful thing and it‚Äôs completely sporadic. I thought maybe it had something to do with smoking or perhaps how much meat I was eating. Maybe it had something to do with my sleep apnea. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But I quit smoking a couple years ago. I don‚Äôt eat meat anymore. I wear my CPAP machine every night. And my heart still does this weird skip-a-beat thing maybe 10 or 12 times a day. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About a year ago, I connected online with a half uncle whom I‚Äôve never met. Long story, but my paternal grandfather and grandmother divorced, my grandfather moved to Florida, and started another family. Well, over the course of our email conversations, I found out that both my uncle and my grandfather have had heart attacks and open heart surgery to correct a genetic heart condition. This got me a bit worried. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So for the last several months I‚Äôve been trying to get it checked out through Kaiser Permanente. My doctor ordered an EKG, which came back normal, and then asked if I'd like to have a 24-hour holter monitor. Indeed I did. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">But KP has been short staffed and evidently has no openings for appointments. It‚Äôs been months now. I emailed my doctor to ask if they could refer me out to someone not in their network, and he told me ‚Äúno - this is not life threatening and it is extremely unlikely that I have a life-threatening condition.‚Äù Well, this doctor can kiss my ass. And so can KP. Here I am, before open enrollment for my insurance, and I want to switch so badly but can‚Äôt because my wife has been seeing the same medical team throughout her pregnancy and the baby is due next month. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I am just so flabbergasted that KP has been so amazing for my wife‚Äôs pregnancy, but absolutely dropped the ball through this seemingly simple - but important - thing for me. I want to get to the bottom of why my heart is doing this, and I think my family history backs up my rationale, particularly since my g-pa died in his 60s from a major heart attack. I wanted to like Kaiser, but I‚Äôve just heard too many crazy stories to stick with them. Even if my heart is fine, I hate the not knowing, and I don‚Äôt think anyone should have to wait on something so important. </p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I made my last car payment this month. It‚Äôs hard to believe I‚Äôve been making that $320 payment every month for 5 years. Hell, I can‚Äôt believe how much has changed in 5 years. But I won‚Äôt go there!</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I also got the private mortgage insurance removed from my house. I bought a short sale a couple years ago with very little money down. You need to have 20% down to not have private mortgage insurance, or 80% loan-to-value (LTV). So I had the bank do a broker‚Äôs price opinion. That came back $120,000 over what I owe, which is like 63% LTV. So we‚Äôre good. My payment went down by $100/mo. Thinking back to a few years ago living in Michigan, this would never have been possible. I bought at just about the highest point out here, but got lucky with a short sale fixer-upper near the MAX blue line. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I‚Äôve also been taking the train to work. My yearly transit pass is paid for by my employer. I parked the car in the garage and haven‚Äôt moved it for over a month. I figure I‚Äôm saving about $100/mo on gas and I have no interest in going back to car commuting anytime soon. My stress level alone has dropped tremendously not having to fight traffic. Plus, it‚Äôs only a 20-minute ride. It was sort of stupid I held onto driving for so long - blame it on my Motor City area roots.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Since I don‚Äôt have my car at work, I‚Äôm not eating out for lunch as much because anywhere I eat I need to walk to. I‚Äôm bringing leftovers most days now. I‚Äôd say, sadly, I used to eat out 3-4 times per week. Now I do about once. I figure I‚Äôm saving at least $80/mo. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">However, I did join a gym and I‚Äôve been going every day on my lunch hour. That‚Äôs $25. I have time to do this since I bring my own lunch most days. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So‚Ä¶I think I‚Äôm saving about $575 per month. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If I removed collision insurance from my car and just got comprehensive, I‚Äôd probably be saving about $600/mo (that‚Äôs $7200/year). </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I mean, that‚Äôs like getting a 15% raise. Isn‚Äôt that crazy? I swear, car ownership and insurance are the biggest scams. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I feel like a lot of people‚Äôs issues with money could be resolved by moving closer to a bus stop. </p>

It‚Äôs getting stranger and stranger going back, if I‚Äôm being honest. It‚Äôs always good to see everybody and old haunts, but the longer I‚Äôm in Oregon the more Michigan‚Äôs problems become glaringly obvious. From roads that will shake your fillings out, to dying downtowns trying their damnedest to hold on, it‚Äôs rough to be there for any length of time. Hell, even the skies are a different sort of gray than Oregon‚Äôs, and that‚Äôs saying a lot. At least here the sky moves and swirls and lets the light through, its rains giving the trees life and keeping things emerald. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It was good to see my family. However, things haven‚Äôt been amazing for them. Eric lost his job at the dealership and Brad is going through a divorce. Mom had her double mastectomy a couple months ago and even though she‚Äôs handling her chemo really well, it‚Äôs still scary. She‚Äôs lost her hair, but she looks healthy, if not more tired than usual. The doctors seem very positive about her prognosis. I know they‚Äôll all get through this. My dad is also retiring soon, so I‚Äôm excited to see how they get to enjoy that. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">It was great to see my nephew Lincoln, old friends, my Gran in Detroit. I visited my other grandmother‚Äôs grave and her old house where we used to live, in Saginaw. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Back here, we‚Äôre cozied up for the holidays and sloshy weather, waiting for our baby to get here. Last night we had a birthing class, which was really eye-opening to me. Shar went last week with her mom since I wasn‚Äôt in town, but last night was my first class. The teacher is great. She was a doula for a lot of years and she‚Äôs a mother of 3, so she really knows her stuff and is giving us a lot of details on what to expect when Sharayah goes into labor. I‚Äôm feeling more confident about it already. I think Sharayah is, too. Two more months and everything will change. Something people can‚Äôt seem to stop reminding me about in their weird smugness like no one has ever gone through it but them. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As for my health, I‚Äôm just a month away from not having had a cigarette in 2 years. I haven‚Äôt vaped in about 5 months. I‚Äôm about 9 months into vegetarianism. I‚Äôve gained probably close to 10 pounds between the quitting smoking and quitting meat. My cholesterol is way down. I changed gyms, to one close to my work, so I can walk there on my lunch break. I‚Äôve been going every day. It‚Äôs awesome. I‚Äôve also been taking the train to work everyday, which gets me walking even more. So hopefully in a few months this can help me shed some of the pounds. Of all the things that have changed for the better, my weight has been one of the few things getting me down. But I will get it done, I will.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p>

  <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Geez, a year goes by quickly. I started this blog out of an excitement for living more intentionally, and as a result of living more intentionally, this blog fell to the wayside. I started a new job that I love, got married, went on a honeymoon, became a vegetarian (7 months!), quit using nicotine altogether (almost 2 years cigarette-free, 3 months vape-free!), and now my wife is 22 weeks pregnant with our first child. Whew.</p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">And yet life has not been all sunshine and butterflies. My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. She‚Äôs about to start chemotherapy this week. It‚Äôs been difficult emotionally thinking about my mom as anything other than super human, but also just being far away and not able to be there for her in the ways I think I should has been difficult for me. My middle brother is also going through a divorce and navigating what that looks like with a 12-year-old daughter. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About a month ago, I deleted my social media accounts that I thought were mostly just a waste of my time. I‚Äôd succumbed to participating in meaningless online political debates and probably lost some friends as a result. I also periodically fell for the trap of comparing my life to other people‚Äôs highlight reels. So I thought it was the healthy thing to do. </p><p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">So I think, instead of trying to maintain this space as some sort of self-help style blog for others, I intend to refocus my energies on shorter thoughts that are more self-centered and focused on my own journey and growth as a human. Anyone who wants to peek in or pull up a seat, by all means¬† </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">¬†</p>

I√¢¬Ä¬ôm sorry you have to go through this, but I know you will only come back stronger, as you have so many other times. I love you. #fuckcancer</p>

			 <p>Two years ago today I bought this house in pre-foreclosure status as a short sale. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not the fanciest, nor the largest, neither is it the type of house I thought I wanted when I moved here. But I√¢¬Ä¬ôm happy to make it a home with @outdoorshar. Getting there. Now, if the heat would just let up long enough for me to finish this paint job. Next summer I√¢¬Ä¬ôm officially calling it: no maintenance, more trips!!!! #diy #rehab #rehabilitation #homeimprovement #pdx #portland #carpentry #paint #housepainting #beforeandafter #midnightblue #house #home</p>

			 <p>I know the exact moment I knew I wanted to marry her. It was our first trip to the coast together, on my birthday a couple of years ago. It was this day, not long after this photo was taken, when She was sitting next to me eating clam chowder in a rundown restaurant overlooking the Pacific and the sun was shining through the windows on her face. I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know then what would happen, I just hoped things would stay as good as they were. Not every day can be a sunny February birthday at the coast, but on the whole, it just gets better all the time. 1 week.</p>

One of his favorite authors was Kurt Vonnegut, and he had an Etsy store where he made and sold lapel pins, such as this (Shop Martin, named after his dachshund). I was able to purchase one that his parents fulfilled. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs an epitaph that is in Slaughterhouse Five. It reads √¢¬Ä¬úEverything was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt.√¢¬Ä¬ù</p>

  <p>One of my goals for August is to get more sleep. I don‚Äôt have a problem with sleeping, especially since getting a CPAP machine a few years ago for my sleep apnea. I usually sleep like a rock. But it‚Äôs the <em>falling</em> asleep that I‚Äôm not good at.</p><p>Not only am I easily distracted and have a tendency to try and get projects done late into the night, I‚Äôm also generally an anxious person and tend to ruminate a lot, especially about work. So I spend a lot of time on my iPad or iPhone as an easy distraction from where my mind might otherwise go.</p><p>Screen time is a major culprit of my sleep problems. I‚Äôve switched to using ‚ÄòNight Mode‚Äô on the iPhone and iPad, a feature that allows you to turn down the blue light that has been linked to keeping us from falling asleep, but it still keeps me awake. On the one hand, reading calms my worrying mind, but it also keeps my mind active when I should be trying to quiet it.</p><p>I had been passing out sometime between midnight and 1 a.m.¬† Then I‚Äôd wake up sometime between 6:30 and 7:00, scramble to get ready, and go about my day. It sets a bad stage for the day, and by the time I get home, I‚Äôm so completely spent that sometimes I can‚Äôt imagine doing much of anything. The lack of sleep also begets more worry about the things left undone, and the cycle continues.</p><p>It also affects my relationships in that when I don‚Äôt get enough sleep, I can be a real grump. Who wants to be around a crabby ass all the time? Not me. It was actually my partner who brought thisnto my attention ‚Äî that not getting enough sleep also impacts her, and that is what ultimately made me realize I needed to make a change.</p><p>So I‚Äôm a little over a week into August and I‚Äôm already noticing a huge difference in my attitude, productivity, and attentiveness. I‚Äôve been making it a point to try and not look at my phone past about 10:30, though I‚Äôd like to roll that back to an earlier point in the night. I‚Äôve also been focusing on my breathing and practicing mindfulness just before sleep. It hasn‚Äôt been perfect, but I‚Äôve definitely been falling asleep earlier more often than not, getting up earlier, and generally feeling happier. I‚Äôm also less anxious.</p><p>What‚Äôs more, I‚Äôm getting some things done in the mornings when I wasn‚Äôt before. In addition to¬† finishing little chores that I sometimes don‚Äôt like to do after work, I‚Äôm getting a little bit of exercise in. I actually went for a run this morning at 6 a.m., something I haven‚Äôt done in a very long time.</p><p>I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that sometimes, when things feel a little off, it‚Äôs good to evaluate some of the simple things first. The way we eat, the amount of physical activity we get, and how much we‚Äôre sleeping. This all may seem obvious, but I didn‚Äôt realize just how much my lack of sleep had been affecting me lately.</p>

  <p>This isn't some pyramid scheme or an ad for Uber drivers. In fact, you don't even have to work any more than you already do. It's actually pretty simple. All you have to do is cancel your cell phone plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Hello? Are you still there?&nbsp;</p><p>OK, hear me out. You don't have to go completely off the grid to still save a load of cash.&nbsp;</p><p>You might already be on a budget friendly plan, but for the purposes of this example I'm using Verizon's Unlimited Plan.</p><p>Verizon, amid increasingly steep competition, started offering its unlimited plan for about $87/month if you already own your phone (a bit lower if you use a debit card) . As part of this new plan, they separated out the cost of their device subsidization so that you could have greater choice over what you want to pay for when it comes to devices. It was probably a calculated decision by Verizon thinking you'd upgrade more frequently, which would keep you tethered to their service. But it can work in your favor. Those device payments are pretty high, but if you already have a device that‚Äôs a couple years old, you‚Äôre likely already saving anywhere from $20-$40 per month.</p><p>This latter part is awesome because, for people who don't need a new device every year, you can save a pretty good chunk of change once your contract is up. I immediately started saving about $40/mo because my contract ended and I don‚Äôt have a need for the newest iPhone. But if you‚Äôre not on contract, you could be saving a lot more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have a feeling that a lot of people are either out of contract already, or will be soon. That's because the new iPhone is about to debut in a few months and a lot of people tend to sign up for a new contract in September when the new iPhones come out. And although tempting, you may want to think twice about lining up for the iPhone X. That's because you'll be paying back your device for the next two years at a price that's likely about $40 per month.</p><p>The more drastic cost savings comes from canceling your cell service altogether. It may be a difficult decision, but it‚Äôs totally doable, especially if you have WiFi at home and at work. If you canceled your cell service, you could easily save over $1,000 per year. In fact, if you're currently paying one of the monthly device fees, your savings could be higher than $1,500 per year. That's not even counting what you could potentially save if you're on a family plan.</p><p>Got Comcast (shudder)? If you do, then you also have WiFi almost anywhere because they allow their customers to piggy back off the WiFi networks of any Comcast-served household. Presto: cell service. That means you could pretty easily go to a WiFi only phone situation with only minor inconvenience. Hey, it would still be downright remarkable compared to cell service and dumb phones just 10 years ago.</p><p>One thing that could make the transition easier is that Google still maintains a free service called Google Voice. It‚Äôs an app you can download that allows you to make voice calls, send texts, and receive voicemail over WiFi. You can use either the Google Voice or the Google Hangouts app for these services. And while you can get a new number from Google, you can also port over your current number to their system (careful - porting will cancel your current cell service if you‚Äôre not ready.)&nbsp; Other options include sending iMessages through your email address or making voice calls through Facebook Messenger.</p><p>Not ready to make such a leap? There are a lot of Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services out there like <a target="_blank" href="https://ting.com/">Ting</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://republicwireless.com/">Republic Wireless</a> that only charge you for what you use. On Ting, for example, you can get 500 minutes and 1,000 texts for $20 per month if you only use data on WiFi. Hell, when‚Äôs the last time you actually used 500 minutes, anyway? Plus, with the GSM SIM card, you can still make calls over WiFi in the native phone app already on your device. That‚Äôs a savings of over $800 per year compared to the Verizon plan. That‚Äôs probably enough cash to pay for most of that trip you‚Äôve been wanting to take for the last decade.</p><p>Now that music streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify allow you to download songs onto your device for playback offline, and Google Maps lets you download map regions for navigation, moving to WiFi-only data is easier than ever.</p><p>Having cell service everywhere without having to worry about data limits is awesome. But ultimately the choice to have it or go without is about our priorities. Personally, I'd rather save or spend that money on other things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

			 <p>When I was looking for a new job, the main criteria was to live in a city that aligned better with my lifestyle choices and personality. I had a good job in Michigan, but I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about where I lived. I really just wanted to try something new because I was in a rut, but decided if I were going to make a big move, I‚Äôd have to be very deliberate about it because I tend to make decisions with my heart and that usually ends up biting me in the ass.</p><p>I was as analytical as possible when I finally decided where I was going to focus my energies in terms of locations where I wanted to apply for jobs. Location was the single most important decision for me when deciding on a job.¬†</p><p>First, I put together a spreadsheet of all the things I wanted out of a place. Job prospects, transit, live music, plenty of outdoor activities, weather, you name it. Whatever I valued, I included. I went to all kinds of lengths to find websites that ranked cities and regions by their various characteristics, and then I assigned my own point values. After that, I added up all the points for each place and ranked the cities. Then I applied to jobs in my top 5 places.</p><p>I landed in Portland just about 2 years ago and I feel like my analytical decision-making paid off. I have a decent job, I met my amazing fianc√© Shar, and I bought a house. I‚Äôm lucky to have the ability to spend most of my free time doing things I love, such as going on hikes and spending time outdoors, exploring Portland and the pacific northwest, working on my fixer upper of a home, and seeing live music. But now my life season is changing again, and it‚Äôs time to recalibrate because I'm not just making decisions for myself anymore.</p><p>I bought a house while I was dating Shar and I made the decision based solely on my own lifestyle and what I valued. I wanted to be less reliant on my automobile, so I bought a house on the MAX light rail line dead center between my job and Portland. I didn‚Äôt want to have a long commute to work because that can be miserable, time-consuming, and expensive.</p><p>But now that I‚Äôm planning on spending my life with someone else and starting a family, my decisions don‚Äôt just impact me. My commute is a breeze, but I‚Äôm not married to my current work. However, it provides the majority of our income. Shar loves her job but she is about an hour away from her work, both ways in bad traffic. She also drives as part of her job, which doesn‚Äôt help things. She comes home satisfied with her work but exhausted because of the drive.</p><p>Therein lies the predicament. I‚Äôm big on living close to my work, but she wants to be closer to hers. Our current jobs don‚Äôt allow either of us to be close to work at the same time, so that means we have three choices. Maintain the current living arrangement, one of us get a new job, or move again.¬†</p><p>We haven‚Äôt decided what we will do or what values are most important to us in the long run. Right now, there isn‚Äôt a win-win situation, and we both are making sacrifices.</p><p>Is having a more fulfilling but lower paying job more important than location? For Shar, the answer is yes, and for me the answer is no. At least for now, but maybe not forever.</p><p>As time goes on, we‚Äôll have to make some tough choices and continue to work on aligning our lifestyle with our life goals. How do you and your partner make decisions on where you work and where you live? What has been most valuable to you?</p>

  <p>There are certainly far more important topics to cover than social media, but I‚Äôve had some thoughts on this topic bottled up inside my brain for about a year now and I felt it was a good time to unburden myself of them. Our collective preoccupation with social media may seem pretty innocuous, if not wholly ridiculous, but I feel strongly that it can have some really negative consequences for both mental health and interpersonal relationships.</p><p>I‚Äôve gone through periods of time when I get completely jaded with social media and I‚Äôll temporarily deactivate or delete all of my accounts. Part of it is my frustration with my own addictive personality and how I can get so wrapped up in it, but I know I‚Äôm not alone in this.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be pretty freeing in some ways to completely ghost from your online life. Last year I deleted all of my social media accounts for six months. All of them. Even LinkedIn, for crying out loud. I was so committed! I was going to be present, dammit! And in a lot of ways, it was the happiest I‚Äôd been in a really long time. Correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but the evidence is pretty compelling that if we‚Äôre more present in our everyday lives, it pays dividends in the form of happiness and contentment.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the benefits: Freedom from prying eyes. Less opportunity for judgment. Freedom from bullying cleverly disguised as differences of opinion. Much less exposure to extremist politics or worrying about being politically correct. Fewer interruptions. More focus. Better in-person connections. Freedom from those phone notifications buzzing your thigh every thirty seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, it was fantastic. But leaving the online life behind wasn‚Äôt without its growing pains.&nbsp;</p><p>As weird as this feels to write publicly, there were some amazing moments and experiences I really wanted to share with the world. I had recently started dating my fianc√© and it would‚Äôve been a convenient way for far-flung friends and family to get to know her, if only in a virtual sense. But what I was least prepared for when I quit social media was how it can feel like some people stop caring about you. Scratch that. How it feels to seemingly cease to exist to people with whom you thought you had a stronger connection.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, just one month off Facebook and the only people who got ahold of me on my birthday were my Mom and my two brothers. No joke. It‚Äôs in those moments when you realize who the most important people are in your life, and there‚Äôs a pretty good chance they‚Äôre not the 200 people who wished you a happy birthday on your Facebook timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>But you know what? After the initial shock of being social media-less wore off, I was probably happier than I‚Äôd ever been. It was pretty amazing to actually feel like I was living in the moment‚Äîin all of the moments‚Äîand not constantly worrying about sharing with the world whatever thing I was doing at the time.</p><p>Recently I‚Äôve been feeling the pull toward living without social media again. But one of the biggest deterrents to not going completely rogue is that I‚Äôve got this blog now and it‚Äôs difficult enough as it is to get the word out. Hell, you can‚Äôt even have a Facebook page for your brand without an actual personal Facebook account. So there‚Äôs that.&nbsp;</p><p>But there‚Äôs also the 13 years of status updates and photos and memories that I‚Äôd rather not have weighing me down anymore. I‚Äôd rather focus on myself now and the man I want to be rather than who I was before today. I don‚Äôt care what your algorithm says, Facebook. I neither need nor want that memory popping up in my feed every year ad nauseam.&nbsp;</p><p>After some serious thought, my solution has been to compromise. I deleted my Facebook account that I‚Äôve had since 2004. I‚Äôve started clean, scaled back the friends list to a manageable level, and I plan to nurture those online relationships that are the most enduring, meaningful and mutually supportive.</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago, I spent some much needed rest and relaxation in my home state of Michigan. Not only was it good for the soul to go back in summertime because northern Michigan is a true gem, it was an opportunity for me to introduce my partner to family and to show her some of the prettier parts of the state since she had only been to Flint (no offense, Flintstones). Besides, I was starting to get a little bit bitter about spending all of my vacation time on frigid Christmas holidays.</p><p>One of the biggest things I miss about home are the lakes. Their beauty and charm are ubiquitous to natives, but vague and seemingly pretty dull to a lot of people I‚Äôve met in the west. Shar, upon seeing Lake Michigan for the first time, said:</p>
</div>
<figure >
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"
   data-animation-override>
    <span>&#147;</span>I have to admit, when you talked about the lakes and how awesome they are, I didn‚Äôt understand what the big deal was. I think most people don‚Äôt. I thought, ‚Äòit‚Äôs a friggin‚Äô lake - whoopty shit!‚Äô Now I know. They‚Äôre like oceans.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
</figure>
<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I forgive her. In my experience, west coast natives have a terrible sense of geography for anything east of the Rockies. I don't blame them. There's just too much going on out here geographically speaking to care much about what's going on back east. But I still like surprising people who don't know any better with a trip to Sleeping Bear or the like.&nbsp;</p><p>Here in the west, there is the ocean and the mountains, all of which provide stunningly gorgeous scenery. I‚Äôm continually in awe of it all and their novelty hasn‚Äôt worn off yet. But there‚Äôs just something about the Great Lakes and the thousands of inland lakes in Michigan that give summer a different feel than what I‚Äôve experienced here in the northwest. It‚Äôs peaceful and relaxing, and it seems like every other person or their family member has a cottage or second home on or near a lake of some sort. It is engrained in the culture of the place.&nbsp;</p><p>With the lakes come quaint lakeside villages and towns. It seems like they‚Äôre everywhere. Tourists flock to them in the warmer months, bringing much needed commerce. I don‚Äôt see the same thing here in Oregon or Washington. The major cities are amazing, dynamic places, but there just aren‚Äôt that many historic little towns to escape to. It‚Äôs pretty sad, actually.&nbsp;</p><p>But having lived in Michigan for 34 years, moving away, and then heading home for a week or two at a time as a tourist gives me some perspective. Those little towns, as comforting as they may be, are depressing places for most of the year, especially for some of the people who live there. There may be a few of them that can survive on skiers or snowmobilers bringing in some tourism dollars, and maybe a couple places have capitalized on being port cities, but there really isn‚Äôt much going on in terms of vibrant economies. Truth be told, I can romanticize them all I want, but they probably wouldn‚Äôt be great places to live full-time. Even if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be of retirement age with a substantial savings, chances are you‚Äôre a snowbird.&nbsp;</p><p>I don‚Äôt think the reasons for this situation have very much to do with the seasons changing. I think it has more to do with how their economies are structured, and more importantly, how we‚Äôve chosen to structure our national economy ‚Äî including allowing the middle class to shrink and the gap between the rich and poor widen.</p><p>There seem to be two schools of thought out there, both of which I think live in their own little myopic bubbles, yet both have truth to them. On the one side, people claim there would be better paying jobs if only we shopped locally - 'SHOP MAIN STREET!'&nbsp;they cry. A well-intentioned philosophy with some truth to it. The other argument is that if good-paying jobs weren‚Äôt shipped overseas and we didn‚Äôt make such little money, we could afford to support good local businesses. People would use their higher incomes to purchase goods in the local economy if there were better paying jobs, which would support still other jobs, etc. Again, well intentioned, but not the full story. The macro and the micro have to be taken into consideration together.</p><p>I‚Äôm very pro community and economic development and want to see local economies thrive. However, what bothers me the most about the ‚ÄòShop Local‚Äô movement is how some adherents to this philosophy seem to ignore the macroeconomics at play that are completely and utterly stacked against Main Street and the working classes. These days, ‚ÄòShop Local‚Äô is a privileged movement for middle to upper income people.&nbsp;</p><p>People shop at Walmart and Amazon and Walgreens because their budgets are squeezed, not because they don‚Äôt like Uncle John‚Äôs TV and Electronics Shop. And why shouldn't they? Who am I to judge the working class family who shops at Walmart so they can scrimp and save to put their kids through college? They're just working within the confines of the economic environment they've found themselves stranded in, where once vibrant and thriving economies have long since disappeared. Sure, people probably buy way too much shit. Big screen TVs, cell phones, unnecessary automobiles. You name it. But if the primary sectors of the economy in which our middle class was built are shipped off to places with cheap labor and little to no environmental standards, how can you expect them to spend what little disposable income they have on local shops? And I can assure you that spending money at Uncle John‚Äôs TV and Electronics Shop is not going to create any middle class jobs save for perhaps John. Maybe.&nbsp;</p><p>What our downtowns in small places have become are caricatures of their former selves and the play things for people who are well off. Take a look around the next time you‚Äôre in one of those places. There‚Äôs an ice cream shop and a few trinket shops hawking tourist goods like M-22 shirts and bumper stickers. But the majority of businesses in so-called thriving places are full of breweries and restaurants. As great as these things are ‚Äî I literally had the best burger of my life at 7 Monks in Traverse City ‚Äî these are the only types of businesses that can‚Äôt be outsources. Yet.&nbsp;And it‚Äôs not because people particularly enjoy spending $15 on a hamburger (usually). They're doing it for the convenience, but more importantly they're doing it because they like the atmosphere or the experience.</p><p>These things are privileges, unlike the days when there was only one appliance repair shop in town and you knew the owner by name. The days when a diverse downtown full of businesses providing necessary goods and services was a way of life.</p><p>As far as I know, there currently is no way efficiency, automation, or logistics can make a burger-eating experience more enjoyable. However, is it very difficult to imagine some not-so-distant future where people spend most of their time in their homes on virtual reality headsets attached to their phones while all of their food is delivered via Uber Eats?&nbsp;Is it that far-fetched when people can order all of their household goods from Amazon by simply saying the word "Alexa - I need toilet paper"?&nbsp;What would happen to our downtowns then?&nbsp;</p><p>There used to be businesses of all varieties, but those peddling everyday products and services can't compete anymore and they're not coming back. Totally gone the way of the buffalo. Should we be ashamed of this? In my personal opinion, yes, but that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm writing this. What‚Äôs done is done. But what I would like to see is the locals acknowledge that ‚Äúbuying local‚Äù is a privileged perspective and that good-paying jobs are not in retail or restaurants. Any ‚Äúbuy local‚Äù campaign should be coupled with a strong economic development plan that goes beyond redeveloping or promoting Main Street.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other benefits to buying local. In my opinion, they are namely the positive impacts that retail and food industry jobs have on historic preservation, and the psychological and community impacts of living in a place that is vibrant at street level. These can, in some circumstances, attract larger economic drivers‚Äîsometimes even in small tourist towns. But this is not possible everywhere and let‚Äôs not continue to fool ourselves about the economic reality on the ground for most people when we talk about the importance of buying local.</p>

			 <div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>I've been thinking a lot about how a change in environment, whether physical or social, can cause people who might otherwise work together toward common goals to be at odds with one another. Sometimes these changes are caused by things beyond our control such as a natural disaster, but sometimes they are by design in order to keep us distracted from larger goals.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most interesting courses I took in college was an anthropology class on ancient civilization. We learned about Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, both part of what was known as the Fertile Crescent. What struck me was how these societies, despite their proximity to one another, evolved so differently. How was it that the Egyptians lived in relative peace for so long while Mesopotamia had so many warring tribes and no real semblance of unity? The difference, it is thought, has a lot to do with the rivers of the region.</p><p>The Nile, on the one hand, has always been pretty predictable in its course. Ancient Egyptians built their civilization upon its predictability, and because they were able to rely on it to irrigate their crops and provide water for basic needs, they built one of the greatest civilizations in history. Their society certainly was not without its problems, but it was relatively stable because the river‚Äôs course stayed true, and the region prospered for it. Economic wealth was certainly funneled up the chain of command, but people were generally able to provide for their livelihoods. On the other hand, the Tigris and Euphrates were not so reliable, and civilization there evolved very differently. These rivers have changed their courses many times over the millennia, and this fact had major impacts on the people of Mesopotamia.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine trying to farm alongside a river that periodically changed its course. In an arid region, irrigation is essential, so if you suddenly weren‚Äôt able to grow crops for your family, or if your community became extremely food insecure, it‚Äôs easy to imagine the stress this would cause. These periodic shifts in the courses of the rivers caused a lot of strife and wars to break out between different groups of people who fought for access to the waters. Although today the region‚Äôs problems are incredibly complex, there are some anthropologists who even argue that these rivers played such an important role in the region that their irregular courses and the strife this caused centuries ago laid the groundwork for the culture of conflict that exists in the Middle East to this day.</p><p>This may seem like a big leap, but I think the situation above is relatable to our modern lives and the political climate we are currently experiencing. Most of us in the U.S. may not have to worry so much about war, genocide, or a river shifting its course on us. At least not in a literal sense. But millions of Americans struggle with poverty and economic hardship within a quickly changing system that is very much the equivalent to a those shifting rivers in ancient times. It frightens me to think about our social safety net dissolving, and the resulting chaos that could ensue. What's sad is that I feel like sometimes, because of my privilege (perceived or real), that people view me as an enemy instead of an ally. I am a white male who is approaching middle age and I live a comfortable lifestyle. But that doesn't mean that I don't have something to contribute to the betterment of society.&nbsp;</p><p>As an adult, I didn't have what I would consider a middle class life until I was about 30, but I did have a social safety net. I had a family who backed me up, provided support when they could, and I had many luxuries by the very virtue of that sturdy ground my family relationships provided. I was lucky, even before I account for the privileges my race and gender afford me. I know that even the fact that I was able to go to school, fail, and go back again (twice if you count my master's degree) was an enormous privilege. As hard as it was to succeed at times, I know countless people did not have the same opportunities that I did, and I'm grateful for those I did have. Yet for someone as reflective and socially minded as I am (if I do say so myself), I struggle at times with accepting my privilege.</p><p>Sometimes it's hard to admit how good I really had it. Sometimes I get angry when people assume that I had everything handed to me or that I didn‚Äôt have to work for what I have. Like my hard work wasn't really work at all because of my privilege. I have to try hard to keep myself calm and not get personally offended when people assume I didn‚Äôt struggle because of my race or gender.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I fail miserably and lose sight of the larger goals of social justice in the face of defending my personal circumstances. I fail at times in formulating my ideas and in communicating my feelings with others. But I do take people's opinions to heart and try to understand their perspectives and hardships. I recognize my own shortcomings, for the most part, and know I still need to work on them. But, in my experience, the social justice warriors certainly don't make it easy to be on their team, either.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what bothers me most is the condescending tone from many people who are social justice-oriented. It bothers me a lot, despite me believing in and supporting many of the ideas they espouse and the policies they support. It feels bad to have my motives questioned when I share a differing opinion, like my actions are worth less than my words despite having worked 10 years in the affordable housing industry, for instance. To have my character questioned and my perspectives minimized simply because of my privilege does not feel good.&nbsp;</p><p>Make no mistake: I believe that all people should have similar footing and predictable ground on which to build a life and not be damned at birth by whatever station they were born into, or by their race or gender or sexual preference or anything else for that matter. Everyone should have a place where they have an opportunity to thrive and provide for themselves and their families. Furthermore, I think sometimes the only means we have in capitalism to provide those opportunities is through social programs.&nbsp;</p><p>I am angered and scared and saddened by the current administration and the potential for its policies to reek havoc on disadvantaged people from all walks of life. I‚Äôm scared for the people I serve at my job and what the future holds for some of them. I feel the swell of emotions and the fear is palpable. But my biggest fear of all is that the alienating language of social justice advocates to the ears of the majority will be counterproductive to the cause and we won‚Äôt get anything done.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't pretend to have a solution, and I don't mean to minimize the rage of the oppressed and less fortunate. Hell, if you're NOT angry, then you're not paying attention. But I feel like most people won't listen if they feel alienated. Would you? This is anecdotal, but I feel like the last election was indicative of that. There were other things at play, not least of which was misogyny. But I know a lot of progressive people who felt alienated by the Democratic campaign because it felt like a war was being waged against them because of their privilege.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to do better and that starts with, at very least, acknowledging those who are on our own team, and then having more productive and respectful conversations with each other. Let‚Äôs not allow these assholes to change the course of the river in order to divide and conquer. If we do, we'll have a lot more to deal with than just having a Cheeto-faced clown for another four years. We‚Äôll have another swamp to drain.&nbsp;</p>

			 <p>Ten years ago my professor, Morgan Sweeney, passed away while on our U.K. study abroad trip. He was a funny, kind-hearted man straight from a novel or movie. He seemed genuinely interested in his students and I had many conversations with him while sitting on benches such as the one pictured, outside of castles and other historic sites. That summer was one of the best experiences of my life (save for riding a coach across the rolling English countryside whilst hungover). Thanks, Morgan.</p>

  <h3>Your Identity is Not Defined by Who or where You Came From</h3><p>Over the years, and for as far back as I can remember, I was intensely interested in genealogy and the stories of my family‚Äôs heritage. Growing up, my biological father didn‚Äôt have a relationship with me. But even after he died, I kept in contact with his mother because she showed an interest in me and my brother. She was born in the US to Italian immigrants and I was always really intrigued by her stories of them. Like the one about my great grandfather being one of the construction workers who put the gold roof on the Fisher Building in Detroit.&nbsp;</p><p>For one reason or another, I always felt like that one-quarter Italian blood running through my veins was more important than the rest. I don‚Äôt think my feelings on this had anything to do with genetics or familial success. Those on my father‚Äôs side were neither particularly good looking nor very successful. What I‚Äôve concluded is that it probably just had more to do with the fact that my Italian heritage was easily traced and that I had real stories going back to the mid-1800s in Vigo di Cadore. The other three quarters of my genetic makeup is such a mix that I never really knew where to start researching, and even though I did make some gains, I didn‚Äôt feel a connection to any of the other cultures the way that I did with my grandmother‚Äôs Italian heritage.</p><p>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in this interest of researching my family‚Äôs past. It‚Äôs practically an American pastime to celebrate, usually in some comical or caricaturistic way, that drop or two of Irish or German blood we claim to have within us. What I suspect is that this pride of ours for heritage is somehow a combination of our collective national identity crisis stemming from the melting pot of our culture, a national philosophy steeped in individualism, and our human tendency toward tribalism. Who knows? What do I know?</p><p>Over the years, I‚Äôve had my own fair share of pride in this regard. Periodically, I‚Äôd sign up for one of those Ancestry.com accounts where you can research your family heritage. But without fail, I‚Äôd usually end my subscription in frustration after only a month. Not because it wasn‚Äôt working; quite the opposite. I‚Äôd cut off my subscription because it was working <em>too</em> well.</p><p>If you‚Äôve ever actually sat down and looked at a family tree, you might know what I mean about getting frustrated, even if you know a lot about your heritage already. These things start out easy. You write your own name down. Check. Then you write out your parents‚Äô names, your grandparents‚Äô names. You put on some coffee. You come back and maybe you know most of your great grandparents‚Äô names and you ask Uncle Charlie for the others. Then it starts to get interesting. You start asking people for help filling in major gaps or you have to go digging through censuses and draft cards and ship manifests. This can be fun. If you don‚Äôt get frustrated at this point and you have some success in your research, the tree continues to grow, and it can grow damn fast, especially if you connect with other users with a common ancestor. At some point you will hit dead ends, but rest assured that each successive generation doubles, whether or not you know who contributed to your genetic makeup or not. A lot of people had sex to make you.</p><p>It‚Äôs even easier to visualize this doubling of ancestors that occurs each successive generation with what‚Äôs called a fan chart. It‚Äôs basically a series of successive circles that start out small. You occupy the center circle, your two parents in the second circle, your four grandparents in the third, etc. Each successive layer gets exponentially larger, and by the time you reach your 10th great grandparents, 2,048 people constitute the makeup of your gene pool. Ten generations might not be that far back, either. There‚Äôs usually 3-5 generations in each 100 year period.</p><p>If we think about deeper time, at least as it pertains to our species, some people estimate that humans as we know it have been walking this earth for about 200,000 years. And if the average generation is 25 years, that means there have been something on the order of 8,000 generations that came before you. Other scientists estimate that humans have only been around 50,000 years and current estimates of the number of people who have ever lived on earth is about 100 billion. That's 15 times the amount of people who are alive today. This fact inevitably left me with the feeling that researching my family‚Äôs heritage was little more than a fool‚Äôs errand.</p><p>Our egos may search for meaning in the past to help us define ourselves today, but we can only come back empty handed. By looking back, it‚Äôs my experience that we are not able to distill some powerful meaning out of our past from a handful of cultures or events or people we are blood relatives with. With any amount of time and reflection, we most often come to the realization that we are all beautifully diluted and that 99.9% of our makeup is the same genetic material as everyone else.</p><p>The point is, we are made up of the genetic code from a vast array of people, and every single one of those people lived a life of their own. Some of them were shitbags and some of them were saints and we‚Äôll never know which were which or even who the vast majority of them were. Furthermore, no amount of historically significant information dug up on our relatives has any bearing on who we are today. We are our own accomplishments and failures, not theirs. &nbsp;</p><p>Still, throughout all of my research on my family tree, whenever I‚Äôd hit a dead end, I found myself wondering what might have happened to that person so that they left no trace and no further information to be found. They probably had children who loved them and parents in turn who probably loved them as well. But the branch just goes quiet. I think this speaks to one of our greatest fears. That‚Äôs the fear of our own branch dying, going quiet, and being forgotten.</p><p>Most of us would like to be remembered after we die. I‚Äôm not really sure why, but it‚Äôs probably the ego again wishing for some small part of us to remain immortal. Unfortunately, history has shown us that the people who are most likely to be remembered are those who were in power, and I‚Äôm inclined to believe that the majority of what we think we know about those people has been fabricated.</p><p>For the rest of us, your great-great-great grandkids likely won‚Äôt even know what your name was, let alone anything about who you were as a person. I don‚Äôt write that to be mean, either. It‚Äôs meant to help unburden you from any sort of ego-driven daydream that anyone is going to care about you when you‚Äôre gone. And that‚Äôs okay.</p><p>Neither the past nor the future matter nearly as much as we think, and being mindful of how you spend your time right now is the essence of living a meaningful life, not worrying about your legacy.</p><p>On the flip side, sometimes people view <em>you</em> as <em>their</em> legacy, which can be just as difficult to deal with as letting go of your own feelings on this topic. When family is closely involved in our lives, I think it can sometimes be very difficult to live our highest and best self when we sacrifice the best parts of ourselves or our own potential for family just because they are our blood relatives (mom‚Äôs excluded ‚Äì happy Mother‚Äôs Day!). Besides the potential for being a huge drain on your time and energy, families are notorious for either putting unreasonable expectations on us or not allowing us to change for the better by consistently reminding us of who we were in the past. For many of us, family might be the single greatest thing holding us back from personal growth. If you find that certain family members are taking more energy from you than they are putting back in, or it doesn't feel like they're respecting your life choices, it might be time to reevaluate whether or not you should be investing so much in your relationship with them instead of respecting and loving yourself.</p><p>It‚Äôs easy to get bogged down worrying about the past or dreaming about the future. If you find yourself anxious about either one, I‚Äôve personally found mindfulness exercises really helpful, and you might too. I won‚Äôt go into details here, but there are a bunch of resources and information on the web and many of the techniques are easy and can be incorporated into your everyday life without too much hassle. I took a 10-week mindfulness meditation course a couple of years back and it changed my entire outlook on life in short order. I recommend it. There are also a handful of apps out there to help you learn some new techniques.</p><p>Also, don‚Äôt sign up for Ancestry.com. It‚Äôs a total rip off.</p>

  <p>This post isn‚Äôt for the nurses and engineers or those lucky few among us in high demand positions who can basically land a job whenever and wherever they want. As admirable and necessary as those professions are, the world needs people from all walks of life and with all kinds of abilities and skillsets. From carpenters and artists to truck drivers and social workers, this post is for you.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who grew up in the wake of the post-industrial Midwest, I‚Äôve had my fair share of struggle. I spent over half of my childhood in poverty and the majority of my twenties in crummy jobs and in even crummier cities. To be fair, there is a lot of good in the Midwest, and this post isn‚Äôt intended to rip on it. God knows it doesn‚Äôt need any more criticism. In fact, I‚Äôve spent all of my professional career in the community development field, a lot of which was focused on trying to make those places better, and many of my closest friends are still working in those areas with the same goals. Things are getting better there and I commend the people who enjoy being there and working to improve it.&nbsp;</p><p>The major problem, in my mind, is that economies are far more elastic than the built environment. By this I mean that when times are good and a place is growing economically, humans tend to build things. We build roads, schools, housing, and infrastructure. All of this is financed by good jobs, whether through the taxes we pay or through the loans we take out to pay for them. We pay our mortgages and the government pays back the bonds it used to build the bridges. The problem occurs when the jobs evaporate. When the jobs disappear, so does the funding to pay for things to be built or maintained. People move away out of necessity and this creates a lack of demand for housing which in turn reduces their value and thus the taxes taken in by government. Things fall apart.&nbsp;</p><p>There is opportunity in the ashes. Cost of living generally goes down in these situations. If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have a good paying job, you can carve out a pretty good existence depending on where you‚Äôre willing to live and what you‚Äôre willing to endure. For instance, before moving to Portland I nearly bought a house in Michigan for $30,000. It needed a lot of work, but it was essentially habitable. The problem was that it wasn‚Äôt truly a place I wanted to live. I dreamed about moving away, but I couldn‚Äôt land a job elsewhere. I had resigned myself to making the best of a shitty situation. I was trying to look on the bright side. I dreamed up schemes where my cost of living was so low that I could basically go anywhere I wanted on vacations to help assuage the pain of being in a deep depression about where I lived. But that‚Äôs not what happened. There I was at 33 years old and hating my life primarily because of where I lived. &nbsp;</p><p>It may be helpful for you to know that there‚Äôs a lot of literature out there in the urban planning and community development worlds, both from the popular periodicals (CityLab/The Atlantic) and in the academic journals that argue that people are choosing the places they‚Äôd like to live prior to even landing a job. The academics are saying that people are choosing where to live based on certain places having the amenities people want and need to enjoy a fulfilling life. A nightlife, recreational opportunities, cool places to buy a coffee, etc.</p><p>Along those lines, here in Portland the joke has been that young people move here to retire. And what people in the Midwest are trying to do is improve their cities so that people will move there, hopefully to create jobs, start families, buy houses and cars, and contribute to the betterment of the economy. Some of them call it ‚Äúplacemaking‚Äù. That term may come and go out of fashion, but another name will take its place that essentially means the same thing. The bottom line is that a lot of smart people have looked at successful places and are trying to recreate them to a certain extent. It‚Äôs become formulaic in that people believe the form of the built environment‚Äîthe shape and structure of buildings and the public realm‚Äîinfluence people‚Äôs psychology enough to want to be there. It‚Äôs like feng shui for cities in a way.&nbsp;</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot of truth to it, even anecdotally. Think about it: who wants to live in a slum or spend time in a desolate, ugly downtown? Not many people I know, unless they‚Äôre really into taking photos of post-apocalyptic economic collapse. With placemaking, we start to see vestiges of life in once lifeless places. Coffee shops and bars open up, sporadically at first. Community development funding helps building owners tear down the crappy 1970s facades to expose the ornamental brick underneath. Streetscapes are remade and bike lanes are installed. Trees are planted and warehouses are converted to lofts. Streets are rolled back and burned out houses are demolished. All admirable things.&nbsp;</p><p>But the economic output just doesn‚Äôt increase the way it once did. At least not for awhile.&nbsp;Sure, the small businesses that employ an enormous amount of people come in, but they don‚Äôt bring in the same kind of prosperity that a Cadillac plant once did. What‚Äôs going on is that these places are in a slow transition period and have a lot more work to do. Those government officials will create slogans and brand their communities to try and make them seem cool and entice people to move there or to stay there. Hell, many of them are fabulously cool. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should stay there.&nbsp;</p><p>What I think goes unnoticed are the masses of people who are woefully underemployed. I‚Äôm talking about the folks with degrees working in restaurants because they can‚Äôt find anything else and the construction workers who get laid off every single year. The auto worker who is technically employed at a temp agency and gets half the wages of the regular employee. Like myself before I landed my first professional job at 29, there are a lot of factors to consider when thinking about what‚Äôs keeping these people in those situations. For some, it‚Äôs proximity to family. For others, they‚Äôve never known anything else. For me, it was the fear of taking the leap without knowing if anywhere else would be different in terms of getting a job. I was fearful of leaving without having landed a position to have the most basic sense of security.&nbsp;</p><p>How does this post have anything to do with minimalism and intentional living? Well, I‚Äôm writing this to let you know that you‚Äôre not alone if you‚Äôre struggling with being from a place that makes you feel like it doesn‚Äôt want you. Maybe you don‚Äôt see it on the surface, but you feel it when you can‚Äôt seem to get ahead in life no matter how hard you try. There may be structural issues at play beyond your control and the only way to correct it is to be as flexible as the economy that left you stranded.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course there is personal responsibility at play as well. Education is a major factor in economic mobility. But there are places right now where there are shortages of workers. Maybe you should ask yourself what is holding you back? For me, it was fear. Fear of the unknown and fear of failure. But once I made the leap, so many things seemed to fall into place. My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt try it sooner. I took the safe route and wasted away years of my life in a place that made me feel like it didn‚Äôt want me.&nbsp;</p><p>If there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve learned on my journey toward a more intentional lifestyle, it‚Äôs that if I would have refocused my priorities early on, I could have saved myself a lot of headaches. I think if I could do it all over again, and if I'd have known then what I know now, I would‚Äôve pared down my possessions to the bare minimum, worked my ass off to pay off all of my debt, and then I would have just leapt for it. I would‚Äôve lived out of my car if I had to and just gone for it. Maybe applied for some temp jobs or worked for Uber or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>I want you to know that if you did the same, you‚Äôd probably be okay. Honestly, you‚Äôll probably be better than okay. The worst that could happen is that you have to go back to where you‚Äôre from. Your state loves you and it‚Äôs giving you away. If you have to go back, maybe it's meant to be.&nbsp;</p>

			 <p>For someone who studied urban planning, I am not naturally very good at planning ahead for activities in my everyday life, particularly when it comes to how I spend my precious free time. I got into planning because I like cities and I want them to be better places for people to live. But planning for my own happier existence just isn't one of my natural strengths. I've had plenty of happy moments, to be sure, and not all happy moments are planned. But I have to be very intentional and focused to change my natural inclination to <em>not</em> plan ahead because I think it's an important ingredient to living a meaningful life.</p><p>For as far back as I can remember, I've been more of a go-with-the-flow type of person. I like spontaneity, and still value it. And more than likely if someone suggests that we do something fun and I don't already have plans, I'm probably going along for the ride. But there was a time when I relied too heavily on other people to bring value into my life by hitching onto<em> their</em> plans.</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with allowing others to bring value into your life. But if you rely on other people for your happiness, you're also giving other people a lot of control over your time, focus, energy, and resources. You may also be putting your friendships at risk if there is a lack of reciprocity by not bringing value into your friends' lives if you're leaning too heavily on them to support your own happiness.¬†</p><p>Now that spring is upon us, it's the perfect time to plan some summer get-togethers or getaways. You may already have been bombarded with invitations to open houses, weddings, barbecues, and camping trips. If not, I assure you they will come. Sooner than you think. You may even feel an obligation to fill up your calendar with everything that comes your way. But know that planning ahead allows you to be more selective. Planning is being intentionally selfish with your time, but not in the negative sense of the word 'selfish'. The positive form of selfishness ultimately empowers you to spend your time doing what makes you happy with those people who make you feel the happiest. Choice is happiness.</p><p>Before your calendar fills up and spring comes to an end, take a look ahead and think about how you actually want to spend your time this summer. Block out an hour or two on your calendar this weekend (with your partner if you have one) and start brainstorming some of your bucket list items and how you can make them reality in the coming months. If you're tight on cash, think of creative ways to save a little money right now. I'm currently trying out an app called Qapital which helps me save automatically whenever I swipe my card. Without getting too wonky, there are even some cool integrations with the app IFTTT which can reward your savings account when you do things like reach your Health app step count for the day. Maybe it will work for you. Alternatively, maybe you can sell some things from around the house when you get your spring cleaning done. Get creative.</p><p>Even though I'm not a natural planner, I love that slow build of anticipation and excitement that comes with waiting for a trip that I've planned, even if I'm only going away for a long weekend. For a couple of months now, my partner and I have been anticipating a trip to the redwoods, a bucket list item I've wanted to check off for a few years. There is absolutely nothing extravagant or spectacular about what we've planned (aside from the trees, the trees! And if you didn't know, its National Parks Week! Admission is free to parks for Earth Day weekend!). But the anticipation makes it so much sweeter, especially after the hibernation-inducing winter we had. And most of all, it allows us to spend some time on our values instead of letting others dictate them for us.</p>

  <p>I try to purchase as many of my household items as possible from thrift and second hand stores. In fact, I consider myself something of a thrifting master. I once bought a $5,000 stainless steel grill for $75 at the Habitat ReStore in Beaverton, OR. I think I must have inherited this gene from my grandmother, whose superhero qualities included going to garage sales to find stellar deals, and digging damaged items out of dumpsters and fixing them up.</p><p>I do my thrifting by frequenting second hand stores on my lunch breaks. I think there must be something to that whole 'retail therapy' thing, because it's just something that I really enjoy doing, even if I don't buy anything. It's a time for me to clear my head and just let my creativity flow. But I think, more than anything, I enjoy it so much because it's fascinating to me what others choose to discard. The whole experience is enlightening because it becomes pretty apparent really quickly what we collectively don't value anymore, especially when some of the wares up for sale seemed ubiquitous or essential when they first arrived on the scene. TiVo readily comes to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the obsolete electronics, dated furniture, and home decor, there are the racks and racks of clothing, most of which was made cheaply by small hands in factories in far off lands. Our clothing has become as disposable as paper plates at a Memorial Day barbecue. And this just couldn't be possible without the cheap labor that makes the end products so affordable, and thus more easily disposable. For more information on this, there is an excellent documentary you can watch on Netflix called '<a target="_blank" href="https://truecostmovie.com/">The True Cost</a>'.</p><p>That increase in clothing supply and cheap access has no doubt been a boon for nonprofit second hand clothing stores and the services they provide. Putting aside my own judgments as best I can, I'm sure the outcome of this cheap clothing economy has also been a much welcomed reprieve by those relatively less financially fortunate Americans among us who want to feel the sense of normalcy and belonging that can come with wearing certain types of clothing, as fleeting as that feeling can be. Although I care very little about branding outside of it sometimes being helpful in predicting the likelihood of buying a durable product, I recognize that this is a privileged perspective to have. Growing up in a low-income household, there weren't many things more important to me at the time than just feeling like I was normal, that I belonged, and few things had the power to equalize me amongst my more fortunate peers than a new pair of Nikes, for example.</p><p>Not too long ago, I found some of those same wants and desires from childhood finding their way out again, and they began leading me down a rabbit hole. I started picking up clothing from thrift stores on a weekly basis. Before long, my closet was completely full. But what I found was not only did I not feel more fulfilled, I actually felt a negative impact on my life.</p><p>The thing is, I wasn't really saving any money by 'thrifting'. I was under the illusion that since I was spending less per item that I was actually saving money. But all those small purchases added up to more than I would spend on just a handful of high quality things. On top of this, mornings were stressful because I had a more difficult time deciding what to wear because I had more in my closet. Laundry day was also an enormous hassle because I could let my clothes pile up because I had more clean clothes to wear. This year I finally said enough is enough and cleared out about 90% of my wardrobe.</p><p>Although my partner sometimes gets annoyed with me because I have a tendency to leave things in the dryer since I wear the same things over and over, laundry day is now a breeze. It's usually a one and done scenario, unless we're doing towels or bedding. Mornings are a lot smoother as well, and I generally alternate between wearing 2 different colored pairs of dress pants to work Monday through Thursday, and I wear my favorite pair of jeans on Fridays. I have probably 10 dress shirts, a handful of really comfortable t-shirts, a couple of hoodies and sweaters, and a few pairs of shorts, but that's about it. Oh, and I got rid of all but my most worn pairs of shoes. I have a brown pair of work shoes, one black and one brown pair of dress shoes, a pair of running shoes, 2 pairs of casual shoes, and a pair of sandals. That may sound like a lot, but I use all 7 regularly as each pair has an intended purpose.</p><p>So now when I go to the thrift store, I am more deliberate about what I pick up. I'm usually on a mission for something very specific, but if I run across an item that I really like, I will usually skip it unless it's an upgrade to something I already have. In that situation, I do a 1-for-1 swap in my wardrobe. Life has been a lot simpler ever since.</p>

  <p>Since 2013 I have lived in seven different places. You'd think with all of that experience that I'd have moving down to a science.&nbsp;But every time, without fail, I'd view the experience of packing with such dread that I'd procrastinate until the very last minute. I'd putz around, packing some things away, but I'd easily get distracted by some sentimental item I would come across and ponder it for awhile, or I'd just get frustrated and look around and think, "how did I get so much <em>crap</em>?" Usually on the last weekend of my lease I'd end up in a mad scramble,&nbsp;throwing everything that was left in the apartment into boxes, completely unorganized. It was chaos.&nbsp;</p><p>In July of 2016, I purchased my first home and moved out of the 500 sq. ft. apartment I was renting in downtown Portland.&nbsp;I wish I could say it was a different experience moving out of my apartment, but it wasn't. What was different, however, was how I decided to move into my house.</p><p>My friend Justin came down from Seattle to help me move, but instead of dragging everything into the house immediately, I only brought in the essentials. What little furniture I had, some of my clothes, toiletries, and kitchenware. Over the course of the next six months, I brought things in from the garage as I needed them. I left the boxes open and just periodically took from them the items that proved to be the most useful. Sure, it was a little messy in the garage at times. A mouse even ate my favorite suit. But it became apparent pretty quickly what things were bringing the most value to my life and those that were just dead weight.</p><p>For the last several months, I have been ridding the garage of the stuff I haven't been using. Donating things that others might find useful, recycling what I can, and trashing the rest. It's been really challenging at times because I didn't fully realize how much of the clutter was due to how attached I'm capable of becoming to things, even if I haven't really used or needed them in a really long time. Those items that remain are mostly sentimental, but what I have left seems really manageable. I think I will be mostly done by the end of this month.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also starting to feel my outlook changing whenever I'm deciding whether or not to buy something new. I didn't get myself into a cluttered situation overnight. It took years and years of unchecked accumulation to get there. But the last thing I want to do is start the whole process over again.</p><p>I'm considering getting rid of my Amazon Prime account because I'm just not ordering much these days to even make the $10.99/mo for free shipping worth it anymore. And when I'm at a store, I find myself seriously questioning the purchases I make, and being more intentional about what I bring into my space. The first thing I ask myself is whether or not the thing I'm looking at is a want or a need. If it is a need, the second question is usually, "how much useful life am I going to get out of this<em> thing</em>?"</p><p>I probably won't be moving again for a long time, and it's a little bit ironic that it took putting down some roots in a larger space to finally declutter.&nbsp; But I have to say, it's been really freeing, and I can feel my stress level decrease just a little bit more every time I take the donation box down to the second hand store.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find yourself getting stressed out thinking about an upcoming move, I challenge you not to move out the way I did. Look around and take an honest inventory of what things you are getting regular use out of and those things that aren't bringing you as much value anymore. I bet if you lighten your load, the move won't be nearly as bad. It will just feel better, because being lighter feels good.</p><p>¬†</p>

			<h1><a href="https://m.afterword.blog/2017/04/03/why-paying-off.html">Why Paying Off All of Your Student Debt is Not Always a Good Thing</a></h1>

			 <p>On their very popular podcast, the Minimalists recently posted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theminimalists.com/p028/">an episode</a> on debt. Generally I think the ideas they espouse are really good, and I've learned a lot of helpful tips from them. In a country where far too many people live in excess, the Minimalists provide a road map for people interested in living happier lives with less.</p><p>However, for those who enjoy their podcast as much as I do, you may have been as disappointed as I am with some of their views on debt. Ryan Nicodemus sort of takes a back seat on this topic, and actually seems more reasonable than Joshua Fields Millburn, suggesting that debt can be used responsibly if necessary. In this episode, Ryan's view is to take on as little debt as you can and pay it off as quickly as possible. Josh, on the other hand, takes an extreme stance that any and all debt is bad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand that the only option is to pay it off immediately‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven at the expense of your sanity, precious time, or opportunity costs.</p><p>My suggestion is to not be too hard on yourself if you have certain kinds of debt. Obviously, take an honest assessment of your individual situation and use your gut. If you want to get on a path to freedom from debt, talk to a financial advisor or a friend who is good with their finances if you don‚Äôt have the skills yourself. In most cases, the quick payoff is the smartest way to go.</p><p>I won‚Äôt go into depth on the Minimalists' ideas about financing your education. Sure, in a perfect world, no one would graduate with any debt for trying to better themselves with higher education. The system is naturally flawed. But just because you did not plan on becoming a doctor or lawyer doesn't mean that it was a bad decision to take on student debt to get ahead and give you leverage to follow your passion. Sure, there are arguments for not getting a degree in certain situations. Sometimes you can work your ass of for a decade, proving yourself over and over again before finally (maybe) winning the lottery for that job of your dreams. But for the vast majority of us, that just isn't an option. Getting a degree is the quickest path to success.</p><p>The long-term earning potential for a college graduate far outweighs the costs over a lifetime. Someone who holds a bachelor‚Äôs degree earns almost double that of someone with a high school diploma, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm">on average</a>. Should you minimize the debt you take on? Absolutely. Schools should also do a better job to help students understand the long-term implications of taking on student debt so that a financed summer in Italy or spring break in Cabo just don't look so compelling to an 18 year old.</p><p>In the Minimalists' episode on debt, one caller posed a question via voicemail. She took on $70,000 in debt to go to graduate school and now works for a nonprofit. She is part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and her question for Josh and Ryan was whether or not she should just pay it all off as quickly as possible or put in the 10 years in public service required of the program and have the remaining debt be forgiven? At first, Ryan started by saying that those programs are there for a reason, but Josh quickly responded that she should just ‚Äúpay it off as soon as possible."</p><p>This is where I wholeheartedly disagree. Because of math. Let's begin with the fact that there is no way for her to erase her decision to take on this debt. Even in bankruptcy, student loans do not go away. However, by working in a public service field, she has the opportunity to have some of her debt forgiven through the <a target="_blank" href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> (PSLF) program through the U.S. Department of Education. Under this program, if you do not make a lot of money (a meaningful career in public service‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägo figure), you can get on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan. These programs can limit your student loan payments to 10% of your discretionary income, as defined by the amount you make over a certain percentage of the national poverty line. If your loans are big enough, you may not pay even the interest on that loan. I know that sounds scary, but hear me out. After 10 years of payments in a public service job, the remainder of your loan is forgiven. And guess what else? All of that interest that you pay? It‚Äôs a tax write-off (up to $2500/yr). Depending on your income, you could get a pretty substantial percentage of your payments back at the end of each tax year.</p><p>Below I run a few basic repayment scenarios outlining why JFM's advice is not only financially bad, but why, in my opinion, it is counter intuitive to a minimalist lifestyle.</p><p>Bear with me while we look at some repayment examples.</p><p>¬†</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Scenario 1‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNormal Payment Plan:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:40px">$70,000, 7.5%, minimum payment ($517.29) @ 25 years (normal gov‚Äôt pmt plan) = $155,188.15 paid in both principal and interest.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Scenario 2 ‚ÄîPay Off ASAP (assumes double payments):</strong></p><p style="margin-left:40px">$70,000, 7.5%, double payments ($1034.58) @ 7 years 5 months = $91,277 paid in both principal and interest.</p><p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>Scenario 3‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe PSLF Program:</strong></p><p style="margin-left:40px">$70,000, 7.5%, income based repayment plan ($400 @ 2% increases annually due to income growth) = $52,558 repaid (the rest forgiven).</p><p style="margin-left:40px">¬†</p><p>Potential savings on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program as compared to the double payment scenario is <strong>$38,719</strong>. And that doesn't even include the tax benefits of up to $2500/yr.</p><p>This is no small sum. Think of all of the things you could do with that money, not least of which would be saving for retirement.</p><p>With a conservative hourly wage at a nonprofit earning $20/hr is $31,200/year after taxes, or $2,600 per month. Double student loan payments would be almost 50% of their income for 7.5 years. We in the affordable housing realm have a name for paying 50% of your income on anything: poverty.</p><p>If she paid the recommended 30% of her income on housing, which is nearly impossible these days with the way that rent is going up, she would be left with about $600-700 per month for ALL of the rest of her needs for <strong>seven and a half years. </strong>That's less than what the average person living on social security and living in public housing makes.</p><p>I can all but guarantee that if she takes their advice that she is going to have the most miserable seven and half years of her life scrimping and budgeting, all while she was trying to have a <em>better</em> life by going to college, not a worse one.</p><p>The opportunity costs, wasted time, wasted money, and lower quality of life all to repay something that would be forgiven anyway just does not compute for me. We can debate whether or not it was a good idea to get into this much debt in the first place, but the ideas presented on the program represent unsound financial advice.</p>

  <p>In the coming weeks, I'll start curating a list I'm calling the Sturdy Thirty. You can find the link in the upper right-hand corner of this page. The intent is to provide 30 recommendations for high quality, durable goods that I, and others, have found useful. Other times, I may not recommend a product at all, but instead an experience or life tip or creative work that I've found useful or beautiful and would like to share. Why 30? Well, because it rhymes with 'sturdy' and it seems like a manageable number to maintain. Keepin' it simple.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to own and buy less stuff and experience as much as I can and I know there are a lot of people out there who share these same values. Whether the intent is to be better stewards of the environment, to save money, or just simplify or enrich your existence, I hope the list will be of value to you. When recommending products, I will try to take into consideration where and how it is made or manufactured.&nbsp;</p><p>But I'm only one person and I want the list to be updated regularly. If you have suggestions that you'd like me to consider, please send them my way! Sharing is caring.</p>

			 <p>Woke up today knowing in my heart of hearts that it&rsquo;s time for a change. When you love everything about your life except your job, it&rsquo;s a scary feeling. The end of 2015 and all of 2016 was great to me. I moved to a great city, found the woman of my dreams, had countless adventures, and bought a house. 2017 will be focused on physical, mental and spiritual health.</p>

			 <p>I get so much more work done in the comfort of my own home. It&rsquo;s too bad my place of work allows this 0% of the time, except on my own time, which is obviously &ldquo;unpaid&rdquo;. Us lazy government workers. If the general public knew how many times me and my coworkers put in 60+ hour weeks without overtime, just because we&rsquo;re understaffed and we care about the job we do, I think maybe there would be less shit talking about government workers going on. And maybe I could have a goddamn beer on my lunch once in a while.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always loved infiltration. To me, that&rsquo;s what punk rock has always been about: going where you don&rsquo;t belong without anyone noticing until it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s not about how you dress. So, I think we chose the venues under the guise of, &ldquo;Hey, this place looks pretty damn beautiful. Let&rsquo;s go there.&rdquo; The Fox Theatre in Detroit, for example. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to wander in this historic place, set up shop and say, &ldquo;the elegant scumbags are in town.&rdquo; -Josh Homme #americanairlines #austintoportland #flight #detroit #punk #iggypop #joshhomme #foxtheatre</p>

			 <p>Latergram. Crappy photo but was introduced to this great place called the Multnomah Whiskey Library last weekend. Speakeasy style place. Took awhile to get in, but the waitstaff are incredibly knowledgeable, even given their 1,500 bottles of whiskey. The library style sliding ladders were a nice touch. Great place to sip with friends on a leather couch in a great space. #pdx #whiskey #scotch #bourbon #whiskeylibrary #library #portland #bar #speakeasy</p>

			 <p>1: it is an unseasonably warm, amazingly awesome day. 2: it is my last day in #Portland and I&rsquo;m trying to not let that bum me out. 3: I wish I had the heart and confidence of some of these not-so-great street performers. Gotta work on that self love. Thanks #Oregon for the memorable and friendly trip. #cheers</p>

			 <p>Since I have Fridays off, I had a four day weekend due to the holiday today. I could use more of these. I didn't get any reading done like I had planned, but I had a fun and relaxing weekend regardless.</p>
<p>On Friday, Kate and I went down to Cedar Point to indulge our need for some cheap excitement. I wasn't feeling the best that day, but we still got in seven or so big coaster rides that shook my general malaise and made me feel truly alive for the first time since I can't remember when. I almost got sick on the Millennium Force, but the initial drop of over 300 feet got me ramped up with a big shot of adrenaline!</p>
<p>I made it a point to not shy away from any coaster, despite my fear of heights. I wanted to feel afraid. I probably feared Power Tower the most. Usually there are long lines, but since it's an older ride, we got right on it, without the usually mental prep that goes along with waiting and watching others experience it. Power Tower is an ominously tall tower that either shoots you up&hellip;or drops you down. We did the version that drops you down. You get cranked up to the top and you sit there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds and the view of lake Erie is tremendous. It was the only thing that kept me from freaking out up at the top. And when it shoots you down the long steel beams faster than gravity, you really almost have an out-of-body experience. At least that's what it felt like to me.</p>
<p>Top Thrill Dragster was by far the most intense, but still incredibly fun. It shoots you to 120 mph in a matter of a couple seconds down a steel course like a dragstrip, only then to be projected straight up in the air over 400 feet, rolled over a curve that points you straight down, and then careened 270 degrees while still vertical, and back to the origin of the ride. It's short, but that's the fun bit. You're not jolted, save for the initial launch of 120 mph, and you have just enough time to get scared out of your mind before you're back down to the safe ground at sea level. By far my favorite ride at the place.</p>
<p>The only disappointing thing about the park is that the people there seemed so trashy. I really tried not to judge people too much, but when you're waiting in an hour-long line for a ride, you get pretty up close and personal with a lot of strangers. The girls dressed so raunchy and the guys were all Hollister-wearing surfer wannabees or dirty backwater Midwesterners. I guess that's what I should have expected at a place designed for cheap thrills. But this didn't ruin the day, it was just eye-opening, especially since I don't have a lot of contact with teenyboppers in my everyday life.</p>
<p>Saturday I went to the lake with my folks and it was jam packed with the same kind of people. A lot of bad tattoos and guys trying to be macho, poor people with kids trying to get a cheap, yet fun, weekend in before they went back to their blue collar lives on Tuesday. I feel like an outsider in those situations, like I don't know how to interact with these Michigan lifers. I know they exist everywhere, but I have to admit that outside of the South, the Midwest probably has the most uncultured white trash in the U.S. I know because I used to be one of them. All the while I try to be more accepting of people, but my lack of understanding of the lives they appear to live has me mind boggled. Funny part is, many of them are no doubt more happy than I am, so who am I to judge?</p>
<p>I'm not wanting to start the week tomorrow, but it's inevitable. I'm going to get some cleaning and laundry done so I don't have to think about it during the week. Hopefully this weekend recharged my batteries enough to get me through for a couple of weeks. Our next trip will be a small one to Saugatuck on Lake Michigan, where hopefully the quaint beach town feel and lack of campgrounds will keep the crazies away long enough for a nice, calm weekend.</p>

			 <p>I find myself coming back to this place when I'm in transition. Now that I have some extra time, I'll write a little bit.</p>
<p>I've just finished all of my coursework for graduate school and I turned in my professional project proposal on Friday for approval. If it comes back approved, then I have the go-ahead to start filming a documentary on public participation in the planning process. I won't name the community, but the project involves demolition of homes in the floodplain and gardening on the empty lots. It's exciting that I might get to be critical, but I just want school out of my life.</p>
<p>Minus 1 year, I have been going to school non-stop since I was 22 and I'm now 29. For six of the last seven years I have worked to support myself while pulling a full course load, right in the heart of my 20s. I feel like this is such a critical developmental stage in a person's life. Despite truly feeling as though I've learned and accomplished much, there is a lot I missed out on. I see my friends who have traveled the world, backpacked, rode motorcycles across the U.S., lived in interesting places, etc., and I've just watched from the sidelines. Year after year, sacrifices. I got in a couple of good experiences here and there. If it wasn't for living in London that Summer after undergrad, I might have exploded. But I've come out the other end of school feeling a bit like I've been in a coma, not knowing who I really am anymore or where I should be or what I'm supposed to do now. It's probably common, but that doesn't make it feel any less real.</p>
<p>After living at such a fast pace, I'm thinking about getting back to basics and in touch with myself, and in touch with my community. I want to sell my car and remove that payment, buy a bike and really make the effort to use it whenever I can. It leaves me with a feeling of calm the way I'm able to just drink in the neighborhoods at my own pace. I feel a part of it.</p>
<p>I want to know what it's like to read for pleasure again. I found a book I bought a few years ago, recommended by a friend, that I started and never finished. I want to relax enough to read it and feel like I'm not doing anything wrong by taking time for myself. I want to lay in the yard until the sun creeps behind the trees and I'm forced to go inside for light.</p>
<p>I will concentrate on being comfortable where I am, while making strides to save money so that my next adventure, a move, is a real possibility. Goals are good.</p>
<p>It feels so good to write this, like a weight being lifted off of me.</p>

			 <p>September already and the nights are getting cold.  I got the new TV on the Radio record and I'm loving that shit to death.   The main problem I had with their last album was their lack of a percussion section.  I need something with a beat, and Return to Cookie Mountain delivers some foot loose grooves to set me rolling and put me in a good mood&ndash;I always need some recorded pick-me-ups when the weather starts changing.  Seems like I get most of my records in the fall.</p>
<p>School has started and it really hasn't set in yet.  Even though I was working and taking summer classes, it's never the same because even though it was time consuming over the summer, it wasn't all that difficult.  Throw five classes in there and I get frantic at times, pulling all-nighters to get everything done.  I was really hoping for a relaxed senior year, but I guess that probably never happens.  I wish I was done, I wish I could not care about it anymore, and not lose sleep over nonsense.  Pitty I might even have to attend grad school to get a decent job, but at least if I had my bachelor's degree I could take it easy for a bit, and take whatever job I could get that pays halfway decent.  Also, as it turns out, I don't think I'm going to take the internship this fall.  I won't get credit, and they don't pay, but I can get credit for it in the spring, so I'll do it then.  I work at the university now, and I'm looking for a second job (that pays).</p>
<p>I got a bit of good news the other night, but maybe I'm just getting my hopes up.  And people that know the situation between me and Justin so many years ago might perk their ears at this, but he's coming back from Seattle.  I'm excited about it.  He was one of my best friends for so many years, and we played in bands together on and off for fun.  I've already talked to him about playing again, and that alone would make my year.  It will be really interesting to see what we could come up with after these years.  Who knows if it will pan out, but here's for hoping.</p>
<p>I'm getting over Sarah more and more every day.  The more time that passes, the more I realize what kind of situation I was in, and the more laughable it becomes.  What's life if you cannot laugh.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve found my way back here because of an old friend who always has the right things to say. The funny thing is, I don&rsquo;t even know where to start because I&rsquo;ve been bottling things up for so long that I feel like I could explode into a mess of flesh and Type O Positive all over the tacky wainscoting of my parents' basement. I guess I&rsquo;ll start small, with humility, and without lying to myself anymore. The truth is, I haven&rsquo;t been happy in a really long time. I was just tired of being unhappy and looking unhappy and sounding unhappy, so I adopted a &ldquo;keep on the sunny side of life&rdquo; facade, always trying to find the optimist inside of me. In doing so, I neglected a lot of negative energy that should have naturally come out of me in small bits. They are instead now causing nervous breakdown. I thought that writing in this shit once again would help organize some of my thoughts, and vent out some of my frustration. Sounds so generic to say that. But I&rsquo;m not going to worry about how things sound. I need to do this. Besides, anything over 2 lines in a journal entry always gets skimmed over anyways. Don&rsquo;t worry, I do it too. I&rsquo;m a hypocrite.</p>
<p>I have trouble talking. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t have anything to say, I really do. My mind races fast with thoughts, but I can&rsquo;t organize them to come out how they should. I linger on statements in my mind before they get filtered down to my mouth, and they never come out as I plan. I pay too close attention to what comes from my mouth, with many pauses. I envy those people who can flow at the mouth as if there were no second thought to what is being said, even if what they are saying is complete and utter garbage in my mind.</p>
<p>I call up my friend Derek out west and he&rsquo;s got this brilliant head on him. I don&rsquo;t think he would be offended if I said that he&rsquo;s not what you would call &ldquo;book smart&rdquo;, but fuck if this kid doesn&rsquo;t have the wit and quickness. He will drive the conversation about his life and somehow make even the most average of everday occurances completely original and awe-inspiring. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever told him that, but Derek, if you&rsquo;re reading this, I really look up to you and admire your fresh look on things. I wish I had that. I just can&rsquo;t think like you do.</p>
<p>Second is my apathy, which controls life situations as well as speech. I don&rsquo;t really watch TV, so I can&rsquo;t speak about that. I barely even watch or listen to the news anymore. It all sounds like hell and I can&rsquo;t even form my own opinions on what I should feel about certain situations and topics. Perhaps I&rsquo;m just a coward and afraid to be wrong. I don&rsquo;t have a mind for names, so even if I do watch or hear something, I can never remember who was in it. I can&rsquo;t tell a story for shit. Music is another thing. I&rsquo;ve stopped playing music and that really bothers me. I barely even keep up on music anymore and that really bothers me. But at the same time I just don&rsquo;t care to try. I only read one book all summer. Usually I read at least 6 or 7. The scary part is, if I have any downtime at all, all I want to do is sit or lie on the couch. I don&rsquo;t like that about myself. I don&rsquo;t like that I can zone out of my life and be complete apathetic about the direction in which it is going, or the person I am becoming.</p>
<p>There are things in my life that I should feel proud of, but I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a senior at at top university in the country and all I can do is kick myself in the ass for not getting it done sooner. I came back to finish a mistake, to finish something I started, and I&rsquo;m doing well, doing really well, and all I can think about is if I&rsquo;m doing the right thing. If I shouldn&rsquo;t have cared so much about this stupid degree. I don&rsquo;t feel any smarter than I was when I started back up, and by the time I&rsquo;m done I&rsquo;ll be 25k in debt (even after the thousands of dollars in grant money). I feel sometimes that I should have followed my passions more instead of compromising myself for this thing we call &ldquo;growing up&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve just been poor for so long that I wonder what it&rsquo;s like to have nights and weekends off and enough money to actually survive on.</p>
<p>I see tons of people that I went to high school with that are married with children and a house and a nice car, and even though I don&rsquo;t want most of these things at this point in my life, I feel like I&rsquo;m judged for not having them. I feel smarter and more creative than most, yet here they are &ldquo;successful&rdquo; by society&rsquo;s standards. I need some validation of my own. Sometimes I just need someone else to tell me that I&rsquo;m doing the right thing. But where is the moral support these days? We&rsquo;re all just supposed to suck it up and expect nothing from nobody because we&rsquo;re adults now and we can only rely on ourselves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about myself the last few months, while dating Sarah. Come to find out, we&rsquo;re almost emotionally identical. So getting mad at each other was like getting mad at oneself, to find fault in the other was to find fault in oneself. I&rsquo;m actually furious at her right this moment, but in being so I have to be mad at Bryan. Bryan doesn&rsquo;t like that. Bryan is a stubborn bastard. Bryan shouldn&rsquo;t refer to self in the third person. Maybe this is a topic best left for a later post, for this is ending up to be a nonsensical bunch of words on a page with no order. I don&rsquo;t really care anymore. At this point I&rsquo;m just talking and letting the words flow as they come because I&rsquo;m so sick of them staying, battering me from the inside, and giving me headaches. Sarah and I broke up, and I think it&rsquo;s for the better, but I&rsquo;ve always been the nostalgic type and have never found it to be easy to let anyone go from my life. I&rsquo;m sure many can attest to that. Done for now.</p>

			 <p>Turn, calendar, turn.  What month is it, anyway?  Loved and lost.  Alive, but grown fat.  Got a haircut, but it's grown again.  Sit second row in history, last in geography.  Wiped some of my slate clean, filled a lot of it back up again.  Grown restless with the agitations of spring:  rain, sun, rain, snow, sun, rain.  Instant communication became passe.  Work a shitty night job.  Wondering where I can barter blood for time to concentrate on the things and people that matter.  Wondering how I can barter that time so that I might find some for myself.  Tired of so many people around.  Since when did space become such a valuable commodity?  I need a ten by ten space with only a couch, a desk and an ashtray&hellip;maybe a balcony on the 25th floor.  A balcony would be nice.  A nap, a smoke, a poem, a breath, a smile, a free fall.  Here's number three, but I only have a cold basement.</p>

			 <p>So this Tuesday I'm going to LA, and I'm pretty excited.  I was a little bummed that we didn't have enough time to head out there last year when we went to Coachella, because I had to make it back in time for exams [we opted for the Grand Canyon which was cool anyway].  I haven't been out of state since, save for the drive to North Carolina to move my brother out of his apartment when he went to Iraq, so I was feeling like a trip was in order.  I'd rather it be a road trip, but I'll take what I can get.  I get to hang out with Derek who just moved out there, my new friend Zoe, and I get to see the Pacific for the first time.  I have to see what everything is all about, since us 'meek, backwater midwesterners' are so naive and only know the LA we see in the movies.  Maybe I'll never come back here.  Or maybe I'll never want to go back to LA.  I bet it's somewhere in the middle of those two feelings.  Anyway, I don't write in this thing anymore, probably due to the fact that I don't lead a very interesting life and it gets kind of monotonous writing about the same bullshit, but I thought this was LJ-worthy.  Peace, and until next time.</p>

			 <p>it's felt so good to distance myself from this techy shit.</p>
<p>i have 4 really crazy classes.</p>
<p>i'll be involved in ethnographic field research projects for MSU.</p>
<p>i'll be proposing ideas in my local community and hopefully receiving grants to make positive changes around me.</p>
<p>i'll be learning about and presenting on various different social movements across the globe.</p>
<p>and i'm learning about european civilization and history, mostly dealing with empires and conquering the globe, post 1500 ad.</p>
<p>i'm already really busy and this feels weird.</p>
<p>i want to be done already, but at the same time i feel like i'm really learning and doing shit that i've always wanted.</p>
<p>i'm back at a decent University, with less idiots in my class per capita, (and the people in my 400 level class are just simply brilliant),</p>
<p>my roommates seem to generally kick ass (hey shawna),</p>
<p>I'm within walking distance of downtown, and buildings, and Elderly Music, and the library.</p>
<p>I have crazy ghetto neighbors, and hipster neighbors who drive mopeds.</p>
<p>the weather has been fantastic (maybe a touch too hot, but the nights are perfect),</p>
<p>I've made a couple of new friends, and even one from across the country (hey Zoe!)</p>
<p>I'm inconsistent with capitalization.</p>
<p>I hope the winter doesn't ruin me.</p>
<p>maybe my follow-up post for the semester (or maybe even in a couple of weeks) i'll be complaining that this really sucks.  or maybe not.  but right now it's okay.</p>

			 <p>I'm pretty much freaking out as to where I'm going to live after summer is over.  Should I rent a room and save some cash, or should I get a studio?  I'm not big on living with people, but the cheaper the place, the less I'll have to work, and the more I can concentrate on more important things.</p>
<p>The writing is at a standstill.  Mostly because I recently acquired Acid Pro 5, Fruity Loops, and various other music production software that's been sucking my time away like whoa.  Music can actually be fun when you don't have all the human factors involved, aka lazy band mates that don't do shit!  Radiohead, eat your heart out. HA.</p>

Do some people actually fall for these scams?  Is there really that one guy out there who logs into his mailbox and says, "Holy shit!...somehow the 5 million I never knew I spent, in a venture I completely forgot I participated in, came up missing!...and despite the remarkable peculiarity of their not knowing whether I'm a sir or madam, they're now going to pay me back this money because they went into a pact with a reputable bank!  Bless their hearts!".  
<p>Who does that?</p>
<p>I must say, though, that despite how impressed I am with Google&rsquo;s spam filter, those <strike>Orwellian tele-programmes</strike> target advertisements &ldquo;powered by gooooogle&rdquo; work a little <i>too</i> good.  Awesome to know that I can get a hotel at a decent price when I go to cash in on this deal.</p>

			 <p>I'm finally doing it.  I'm attempting to write again, and not just in a rambling, psuedo-poetic sense either.  This time I actually have a plan, a general storyline, and I'm in the process of creating character sketches and doing geographical research.  There is still much work to be done, but once these hurdles are out of the way, the actual writing will be a snap, and fun!  It may be slow going when fall begins, but this should give me something creative to focus my energy on in the downtime.  I'm thinking about calling it Ink&amp;Watercolors, but this is only tentative, as I'll never know what's really relative until it's polished.  I'm <i>really</i> excited.</p>
<p>I'm red as a lobster.  I went out on the lake with my dad yesterday for about 5 hours and we ran out of sunscreen.  No bueno.  Thank god for aloe.</p>
<p>Also, I have a pretty good prospect for a place to live thanks to <lj user=&quot;Altzen&quot;>.  I will know in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Between a few thousand dollars in grants and a few thou in loans, school is set and keeping me comfortable&hellip;for now; though I don't like the loan part too much.  I guess all that I can hope for is a decent job when I graduate so that they won't become too big a problem.</p>
<p>But I'm definitely getting one of these sometime next month:

			 <p>four hundred pages into crime and punishment in two days.  it's been sitting in my library for about 4 years and it has just now felt right to read it.  i remember the exact day i bought it, too.  from one of those creepy booksellers at the flea market 4 summers ago on my way to lansing.  he was absolutely mad.  i offered him $100 dollars for the whole box (they were collector's books, but none were in great shape), all classics.  i did some quick calculating and presented my offer to him, though he turned me down.  i took 3 of them and told him that he of all people should know that he wasn't going to get that much money for them in a hundred years, especially judging by the character of his 'clientel'.</p>
<p>i guess that is beside the point.  now i think that maybe i wasn't <i>supposed</i> to read them.  i don't know why, but i'm a firm believer that certain people and things come into our lives at certain times, not fatefully, but instead to set out their hands for you to grasp if it is your position to do so at that place and time.  our lives are nothing but a series of these events, thousands of hands lining a gauntlet where at any time you're free to grasp the ones you want to take with you.  sometimes you're not in a position to do so, or you're concentrating on other things and fail to notice.  other times you're presented with too many choices and can only make but a few, leaving the others forever in the past.</p>
<p>the loophole for me is books.  they are frozen in time, but at any point can influence your life emmensely.  not necessarily the world around you, but certainly your outlook can change in a matter of days.  you can give them as gifts and alter other people.  you can converse over them with people that have grasped the hands of those books, too, and it's as though you were both at the same place at the same time, even if you've never met said person beforehand.  intimate relationships can be sparked.</p>
<p>as i've said, i have books that lay around that i never read until it's in my guts time for me to do so.  you cannot force these things.</p>

			 <P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;>been a while, old friend.&nbsp; clean slate?&nbsp; tell that to the ghosts.&nbsp; they&apos;ve been knocking around in this old head of mine...conspiring through the walls where they&apos;ve been captured..err...were captured.&nbsp; i&nbsp;should probably&nbsp;leave that analogy dead in its tracks.&nbsp; but the fact is they&apos;re here, really here, and i&apos;m not bottling them, and hiding them in places any longer.
<p>mystic thought would have me forgetting my ego, transcending myself so to speak; and believe me, i've tried on a daily basis for years.¬† when i really concentrate i can get it, and other times when i'm not paying attention&ndash;mind so numb it doesn't want to function anymore&ndash;i get it then, too.¬† those are the islands.¬† was it Huxley that said we are our own island universe?¬† i forget.¬† i don't think my transcending self has been natural.¬† if there was a line, say from chicago to new orleans that represented a natural progression toward enlightenment, or simply a calm, quiet,¬†well being, then i would have to say that when my mind goes black¬†i'm somewhere in the upper stratosphere¬†falling toward some point along that line.¬† the harder i fight self, the stronger it comes back.¬† this¬†has led¬†me to believe that i've needed these few steps back in order to make it¬†a couple steps forward, comfortably.¬† one foot in front of the other, firmly planted on the ground.¬† everything out in the open.</p>
<p>i've been considering lately¬†the possibility that all of the drugs i've taken have come back to bite me in the ass, and maybe i'm permanently fucked up because of them.¬† i don't know how seriously to consider this for the sheer fact that i've known plenty of people who have done more drugs than your average touring funk band, and all in all, they are quite fine individuals.¬† i was never a junky.¬† i never did drugs on a regular basis, ever.¬† i've never done¬†heroin or crack or meth, but given the mental state of certain family members, i would say the drugs could do nothing but compound the problem.¬† i have my doubts, but i won't rule it out.</p>
<p>the truth is things aren't bad.¬† things certainly aren't fantastic, but i shouldn't have anything to complain about, or be as grumpy as i am.¬† family is alive and well.¬† on a decent course in life that i feel confident about.¬† i'm¬†beyond ¬†broke and quite a bit lonely at times, but the money thing doesn't bother me so much because i'm disgusted with 'things' anyway.¬† i could use some love.¬†¬†i hear there are worse things than being alone, and i believe that to be the truth.</p>
<p>i am a fear-filled person.¬† i may look and sound like a hard ass on the outside sometimes, but rest assured those are just well developed defense mechanisms.¬† i'm scared of people.¬† i don't like public places because i hate people.¬† yet i force myself into those places and situations constantly in hopes that maybe i'll develop as a person.¬† im an adolescent again, entering freshman year, completely the object of scrutiny; but instead of all of the hate coming from the farm kids picking on the city kid, coming from the outside in, i'm turning my insides out with self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy, and sometimes all out self hatred.¬† the best example i can give of what goes on in my head is in the movie Adaptation.¬† Kaufman's monologues are very similar to what goes on in my head on a second to second basis, 85 percent of the time.¬† i have done some reading up¬†on the brain and from what i've gathered, thinking at the rate that i do uses a hell of a lot of energy.¬† this would explain the constant fatigue, and also might have something to do with my not gaining weight. ever.</p>
<p>even with my closest friends, despite their subtle and even not-so-subtle reassurances that should tell me¬†i'm an a-okay person, i still question my worth as a person in their company.</p>
<p>i don't feel better than people.¬† not even necessarily do i¬† always think that i'm worse than people.¬† i just feel different than people.¬† i don't understand them.¬† i don't understand the constant striving for money and possessions.¬† i don't understand the constant diluting of a culture by the next pop sensation.¬† do people read anymore, or is that a lost art?¬† i don't understand the closed-mindedness.¬† i don't understand the fighting against stereotypes when they are reinforced, in my eyes, day to day.¬† i don't understand why everyone is so standoffish, and when somebody such as myself isn't, there's always something¬†that comes back to kick¬†that person¬†in the ass three-fold.</p>
<p>i am an old person who doesn't want to grow up?¬†¬†until recently¬†i would have been ashamed to admit that i'm a very intelligent person who lacks a lot of so-called common sense knowledge, and/or life skills.¬† before this year i couldn't have cooked anything unless it came out of a box with instructions.¬† i set my bills to pay automatically because i'm so forgetful of things, they'd never be on time.¬†¬†i've relied¬†on people too much, such as family.¬† i don't have a savings account.¬† small talk is a big deal.¬† i've no wit whatsoever.¬† just cynicism that rubbed off on me in a friendship¬†that no longer is,¬†that i try to pass off as wit in those situations that call for quick comebacks.¬† i'm super bad with names.¬† i'm a super good listener if there's a chance that i can have some sort of relationship with the person, but if i don't like them, tough luck.¬† i can't see that side of the coin, and i don't expect them to see mine.¬† i'm stubborn as hell.¬† i change my mind all the time.¬† &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;<a href="st1:place">st1:place</a><a href="st1:City">st1:City</a>new york&lt;/st1:City&gt;, <a href="st1:State">st1:State</a>LA&lt;/st1:State&gt;, <a href="st1:country-region">st1:country-region</a>new zealand&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&hellip;fuck it, i'll end up here working at a gas station, or a bum/prophet.¬† meet me behind the new chain restaurant.¬† the food is still warm.</p>
<p>i don't know if i'm lucky or damned to have people who support me all the way, but i can't help but feel like someone should have thrown me into the deep end a long time ago.¬† here i am, all dry, with the attention span of a¬†5 year old dyslexic, delusions of grandeur, sexual frustration and inadequacies of a pubescent boy, &quot;knowledge&quot; beyond my years, and the senility of a 75 year old dementia patient.</P></p>

			 <p>After last night's disappointing SNL, I decided to make a cigarette run.  I pulled out from the fill station and drove around Lansing because I didn't feel like sitting around the hotel any longer.  I drove down Cedar, and headed downtown to check out the skyline for a minute, and then headed in the general direction of the airport just to get my head straight.  I saw some wierd lights in the sky but they were pretty faint because of the light pollution.  I drove out to the country and saw an amazing episode of Aurora Borealis.  Light was flying all over the sky in waves and the electrical storm was most intense directly overhead, almost taking on the shape of a nebula.  It took me a while to find a place to pull in and park because of all the florecent lights and trees obstructing views of the sky, but when I finally found a place I pulled in and sat there in the wee hours of the morning watching the storm while the sun began to rise, slowly chasing it across the sky and then finally swallowing it whole.  There's something about it that has a pacifying effect over me;  my head gets clear and I can't help but feel overwhelmed with happiness; all worries of time and place are filed down to nothing by pleasant reverie.  Last night was my second experience with the northern lights.</p>
<p>The first time, four years ago, I watched the northern lights while lying in a hayfield surrounded by a wood, camping in the back country near Cadillac Lake.  Amazingly enough the earth passed through a stream of asteroids that weekend and the Aurora Borealis danced with a meteor shower.  Lying on a blanket freezing my drunken ass off I fell in love with a girl who fell in love with me while the sky blazed.

<p>I think I might head down to Chicago tonight to see Deerhoof at The Empty Bottle.

I&apos;m apparently the reigning champion of procrastinators.&nbsp; My work load isn&apos;t all that bad,&nbsp;considering I quit Japanese sometime in the middle of the semester,&nbsp;but I did manage to save three papers&nbsp;for my other classes till the last minute.&nbsp; I&nbsp;ended up writing&nbsp;through the&nbsp;night, first for American Studies and then a reflective piece in the morning on Rumi.&nbsp; I ended up e-mailing it and I got a little bit of much welcomed praise.&nbsp; Things like this make my day:

Thanks Bryan. I enjoyed the class a great deal--I really found your willingness to think about these ideas and be honest and open in discussion to be important to the success of the class. You are a smart and thoughtful student--best wishes in your future studies and in life in general.
<p>I still have a couple of your papers&ndash;especially your Walt Whitman-esque poem from the first project. The Whitman poem is excellent, and the connections you made in your Gilded Age paper showed a comprehensive grasp of the themes we have been talking about.¬†<IMG src=&quot;[img.photobucket.com/albums/v4...](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v41/inthedeltawaves/random/walt-whitman-biglight.jpg&quot;) align=left></p>
<p>Good luck in the future, and keep thinking.</p>

Earlier in the semester we had the choice between a)writing a paper on the Transcendentalist movement in the midst of the westward expansion, or b) create my own original artwork in the style of my choosing that reflects the ideas of Transcendentalists.¬† So I wrote a quick poem before class where I tried to emulate best I could a Walt Whitman prose piece, reflecting the time frame:</P></BR>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 27pt;

			 <p>My brother is coming home on leave from Iraq in a couple of days.¬† It's going to be nice to see him.¬† Have a few drinks and play some cards.¬† It's always funny when he comes home because they aren't allowed alcohol in Iraq, and he always gets really shitty and funny drunk when he comes home.¬† Last time he ordered some of this bunk-ass absinthe and sent it home so it'd be waiting for him when he returned.¬† Notwithstanding the bunkness of the¬†absinthe itself, the alcohol content was way up there, and¬†little to say we polished it.¬† Us Robb's are pretty funny drunks.  We it's fun rambling about old times.</p>
<p>I remember when we were just little kids, when we we're going to Westdale Elementary in Saginaw.  I was in first grade and he was in Pre-K.  We used to get into fights all the time.  There were these two book bags that we had and since we were pretty poor, one of the bags was really plain, and the other was this decidely ugly and uncool cheap plaid bag that was totally tattered.  We used to fight over whose turn it was to have the plain bag for the day because we didn't like being seen with the plaid one.  How ridiculous we were!  We always went to the richie schools but always lived in the smallest, poorest section of the school districts.  When we moved to Midland it was even worse.  We lived in a small two bedroom apartment while all of our friends lived in these huge and gorgeous places that used to make me feel sick to my stomach with envy when I'd walk home from school.  Of course we always walked.  We would have rather died than be seen dropped off in our old stationwagon.  Looking back I feel so foolish thinking that money was such a great thing, and the hell my mother must have put up with raising us alone on what she could.  My brother and I used to come home after school and nobody was there to watch us because my mom was at work.  She was making just enough money to not qualify for any assistance, and our father was never in the picture so he never sent money.  Sometimes we'd forget the key and we wouldn't have anyway of getting in the apartment.  Sometimes, if we were lucky, we could climb up to the second floor balcony by stepping on the gas lines that ran up the side of the building.  On occassion we could jiggle the sliding door just right and get in.  Other times we had to wait in the park.  Man those were some hard times.  I'm glad I went through it though.  I don't know what type of person I would have become if I were one of those people who had everything handed to them their entire life.  I don't think I'd have appreciation for anything.  How could I, if I never earned it?</p>

			 <p>So¬†I <EM>have</EM> been reading Bluebeard; thank you for that.¬† I'm taking it in chunks because I like to read K.V. slowly and taste it.¬† I didn't think I would, but you were right.¬† I like it that you underlined parts in it because I can almost tell what you were¬†thinking when I read those chunks, but I don't like &quot;<U>Potato BARN</U>&quot; written in places because I'm afraid you're going to give away the ending, if you haven't already.¬† I didn't talk to you today because I didn't want to talk to ANYone today, and getting all those calls made me even more reclusive.</p>
<p>I started writing something after a huge brainstorm, and I sat at the page reworking about five sentences over and over again until it was just right.¬† I intend this to be a novel, so I'm assuming that it'll be 2050 before it's done.¬† At least when I'm doing that I'm not thinking about anything else, kind of like Rabo Karabekian's friends.¬† Except I'm not watching how the paint falls on canvas. I'm lingering on words.¬† I'm dodging my other obligations. But I guess that's not anything new.¬† I'll fabricate something to do instead of face the real problems directly.¬†</p>
<p>I got carpet in my room today.¬† Finally.¬† So I have a bed, which is always a good thing to have, and I have a desk.¬† And a record player.¬† Beatles records, Pauls Simon and Art Garfunkel reminding me of when my grandma would dance to <EM>Mrs. Robinson</EM>, singing in her old person voice and making me smile. ¬†(Some people's <EM>parents</EM> are as old as my grandma.)¬† I've taken four boxes of miscellaneous hazerdous waste that has collected over the years and condensed it down to one.¬† Who knows why I save the shit that I do.¬† Whenever I used to pull it all out it did nothing but remind me of the best and worst times of my life and make me so nostalgic that I'd get <EM>nauseous, </EM>and end up getting pissed off at myself for choices, or pissed off that I couldn't be back in those times, or pissed off that I'm not as happy as I was then, or pissed off that I couldn't run a 4:25 mile now if my dirty life depended on it.¬† I feel that getting rid of this stuff will just let my mind do what it will with all of those thoughts and feelings, and throwing the shit away is the best way for me to move forward instead of always looking back.¬† Now, If I could just concentrate on getting through <EM>today</EM> more than thinking about <EM>tomorrow</EM>, I just might be okay.¬† That sounds absolutely unauthentic, and it is.¬† But it's true nevertheless.</p>
<p>The funny thing about heading toward your Twenties is that you think that they're going to be fantastic.¬† At least I thought they would be.¬† Sure, I've had some pretty fantastic times.¬† Maybe twice a year, when I'm drunk enough to forget myself, but not drunk enough to misplace myself.¬† I thought you were supposed to enjoy these times?¬† Fuck these times.¬† People just leave.¬† That's all people ever do is just leave.¬† Maybe that's just the Midwest, I dunno.¬† Suddenly I feel a longing to be in an episode of <EM>Cheers.</EM>¬† <em>SINGING</em><EM>sometimesyouwannago where everybodyknowsyourname*.</p>
<p></EM>Let's do a quick recap of my adult life.¬† Here we go.
Graduate high school, with honors.(+)
Get into U of M, move to Detroit¬†(+) Working at Meijer (-)
Move to East Lansing to be with Larice once again, failing out of MSU miserably after only a year. (-) 7-11 (-)
We break up, I move home because I'm no longer in school.¬† Work various mindless jobs for this period.(-)
Get an apartment in Lansing for a year with Angie doing absolutely nothing with myself.¬† Chi-chi's.¬†(-)
Move to Naples for 6 months with Angie,¬†working @ surf¬†shop, cheats on me, do absolutely nothing with myself. (-)
Move to Jacksonville for six months so I can establish residency and start school again, but I'm kicked out of my place with no money saved, so I have to move home.¬† Still nothing. (-)
Work the summer at Alma College as grounds crew. (-)
Start at LCC (+)¬† Working at gas station. (-)
Slept with my best friends girlfriend, thus destroying every social tie that I have (&ndash;)
First year, 3.8 gpa. (+) Working at gas station (-)
Second year, 3.5 gpa (+)¬† Working at P.F. Chang's (-) Apartment okay for the most part aside from my being fickle.(+/-)</p>
<p>I have a larger collection of name tags and hair nets than Wayne Campbell.¬† My <EM>resume.</EM>¬† Brilliant.¬† I may be on the upswing.¬† I don't know.¬† School has been all right for the most part, but it's pretty discouraging when you're 24 and¬† you've barely got 70 credits and you see 21 y/o kids graduating and moving off and doing great things.</p>
<p>A change of mindset is in order.¬† Or a hefty kick in the balls.¬† So what's done is done and I just needed to ramble so I can set this day in the past and leave it there.¬† <EM>Cheers.</EM></p>

			 <p>today i woke to the sound of my focus-challenged, seventeen-year-old brother, and my 43 year-old mother fighting because she didn't wake him up in time for school.  my brother, who has been through four high schools, for various reasons, many of which i believe to be fiction, has once again accumulated more than nine (9) absences in the better half of his classes this <i>semester</i>.  meanwhile, in a not-so-distant corner of the house, where i was coming out of a dream where i was supposedly some kind of motorcycle pro who has just come out of a coma and is getting back into his training regiment, hear the sound of an adolescent boy's whine reverberating off the freshly de-carpeted wooden floor of the house, down the hall, and into my dreaming head.  five years ago i would have screamed back.  today i just opened my eyes to the sun coming through my bare windows and listened.  i felt for my smokes, which are never farther than an arm's length from me at all times.  i pulled one out, lit it, and took a drag that would have knocked me down if i hadn't already been in my bed, and when i exhaled it did that thing where all the spinning smoke is automatically highlighted when it reaches the rays of the sun, contrasted to the shadow where the sun doesn't reach.  i listened to a little bit more of the conversation as i finished the cigarette, yells and stomping feet&hellip;&quot;it's all <i>your</i> fault, and now i'm gonna hafta take those classes overr!&quot;&hellip;&quot;NO, whose the one who had all of those absences to <i>begin</i> with?!&quot;&hellip;&quot;well i was gonna go the rest of the year&hellip;why didn't you wake me up??&quot;&hellip;&quot;you're seventeen years old, can't you set your alarm?&quot;&hellip;yada yada.  it's funny, but not so funny.  i mean, i've known for a while that my brother has been fucking his life up.  and as i lie there smoking, i thought to myself, &quot;oh, eric. if you only knew how hard you're making this on yourself&quot;.  and it's too late.  we've done everything for him, from helping him, offering to help him, offered counseling, fought with teachers to keep him, changed schools to get a fresh start, tried medication.  he spends a lot of time on his car.  more than a healthy amount of time sanding, inhaling fumes, painting, ripping this out, welding that.  he's pretty good at it.  the trouble i had lying in bed there, listening to the fighting, was my belief systems.  i'm not quite a fan of our economy, our political system, capitalism, the american dream.  sure, we all dream about stuff.  we all have dreamt about being a great (fill in the blank).  and it has us chasing these things without heart, recklessly.  not just things, but status and power, too.  and on countless occasions, i don't know how many (but probably far too many), i have sat my brother down and tried to get his goals out of him, push him towards something, to use his brain.  to focus.  to set the bar high.  but as i look back, i wonder why i should put any more effort into it.  why should i have him chasing these things?  if he finds happiness in simple things, like working on cars, so be it.  if he achieves that, then that's more than i can say i've accomplished.  why should i give advice to someone who doesn't want it? in addition, why should i, the giver of that advice, say anything at all when i could use some counseling myself?  so i continued about my day in the normal fashion.  smoked a lot of cigarettes, did as minimal as possible.  i sat in my car an hour for the warmth and the silence, clearing my head of all the trials my head fabricates, trying to dissolve fears, narcissism, clutter.  i dressed up to go no where.  i looked at myself in the mirror, &quot;i'm ugly, i'm pretty, i'm ugly, i'm pretty&hellip;&quot;,&quot;&hellip;my mother was a real woman and my father a real man, what am i?&quot;  i cannot go back to working mindless jobs.  i can't stand to work with one more person who's about as bright as a fork in a microwave.  then i think, &quot;goddamn, that's such a mean thing to say.  what's wrong with manual labor and finding enjoyment, maybe even enlightenment in it?&quot;  thus i teeter, back and forth in my thoughts, only becoming clear when i force meditation upon myself.  can it balance?  i think that i'm great, then i think i'm worthless.  i wonder how much is indoctrination.  how many of my dreams are prescribed by this place in which i live, how many aren't complete fabrications.  what won't i accomplish by my lack of commitment to anything or anyone?  what <i>will</i> i accomplish by wanting to do everything, be everywhere at once, and be everything to everyone?  absolutely nothing.  but will i die happy?  i'm still working on that.</p>

			 <p>It's times like these that I'm glad that I don't keep a lot of personal possessions.  I'm moved out of my apartment and it really didn't take more than two days to get everything organized, packed up, and moved.  There is one thing that I'm neglecting, though, and it's painting over the walls.  I shouldn't have ever done it, being that it's an apartment but I was tired of living in mind-numbing white.  Hopefully I'll finish that up tonight.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about heading over to the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship as a spectator on one Sunday to see what they're all about.  I'm not really into organized religion, and I'm sure those who know me the best would say that I've said more than my fair share against them.  But I think that these people are kind of the anti-religious-establishment establishment.  I was researching their stuff and at very least they sound uncommonly interesting to me.  They're so open minded that I've been wanting to check them out for the sheer sense of community&hellip;and possibly so I can do some volunteer work.  I don't know what I'd do, but I feel that I've got a lot to be thankful for, and there are plenty out there that have nothing, so why not do what I can instead of griping about things all the time.</p>

<p>Also, I'm probably a little late on this train by a couple of months, but I've been listening to <b>Bloc Party</b> and it may just be true that they saved music for me.  I was starting to think that there were no truly sincere bands out there&hellip;that also whaled like nobody's business.  These folks most certainly do, and I'm rockin' it like it's hot.  Don't listen to the hype, just grab the album <b>Silent Alarm</b> before you're the last person on earth who hasn't heard this heroic band.  Also, I'm pretty damned excited about the 6 re-releases of all the Super Furry Animals discs.  Too bad I'm pretty much flat.  British Sea Power also.  I do have the ole iPod.  Someday I'm going to need and repent for not paying these wonderful people.  My logic - they're a lot richer than I am, and they're not eating kraft dinner&hellip;so when I'm old and loaded from retirement and booze, I'll go through the old collection, and any band that I feel changed me positively in some way&hellip;I'll buy two of every copy.  No I won't.</p>
<p>Lately I've been so incredibly lazy.  I think that the last year has caught up with me, working and school and partying and trying to balance it all out.  I don't have much motivation to do anything this week.  It's like a mini vacation.  My body is catching up, and maybe I'll be recouped by this weekend.  Until then, I'm just concentrating on myself.  I've neglected that person.</p>

			 <p>i spent the afternoon
and much of the evening
right here</p>
<p>much of the morning too</p>
<p>the sun hid
for the better part of a season
this midwestern gray
with its skies drained
like my lungs
suffocating with a Camel‚Äôs
all deliberate speed</p>
<p>but today
no, yesterday
the sun decided
he was tired of suicide notes
and came out with guns blazing
forcing me to class</p>
<p>to those trite teachers
flagrantly approaching godliness
to themselves
and to the mindless dummies
who grasp convictions based on cynicism&ndash;
like fashion coughing up
whatever hasn‚Äôt been stated
except in the vague references
of  music
and the undercurrents
of a popular-by-unpopularity-
existential-
bullying weak
who at first surprise
with vocabulary
but who still
haven‚Äôt any idea
what the fuck they‚Äôre talking about</p>
<p>they‚Äôve found a taste for coffee by day
and despondence by night
bellowing obscure words
like swooning disaster
at the end of the bar
to the girl with the pink pink skin
pink pink skin</p>
<p>legs long as knives in loins
dress hiked to the barstool
peeking white cotton panties
when she laughs, she laughs</p>
<p>what was her name</p>

			 <p>Last night the fill station attendant wore a thigh-length, faux fur coat, a garment whose strands were at least three inches in length, and black like that of his own locks.  A subtle, pink neck bore the only separation of the two, leaving his head dangling in space above the jacket like a dot atop an upside down exclamation point.  My excitement was not for the coat, but instead for the passion in which he wore it as he collected bags of trash from outside!</p>

			 <p>I returned from a trip a couple of weeks ago only to find something written on the living room wall.  It read:
<b> &quot;No matter how far a jackass travels he will always come back a jackass&quot;</b>
I don't know that it was directed at me but I found it rather uncanny to have appeared soon after I returned.  To be quite honest, that was the straw that broke the &quot;jackass' &quot; back.  I put in my notice at work and told my flatmates that I've got to leave, and that I'm doing it ASAP.  I'm thinking with more humility and attempting to get in touch with reality.  I'm fed up with trying to make a puzzle piece fit that was never meant to, tired of quotas and status, or the appearance of them; all in all my goal is just to get back in touch with myself.  I don't know that it will happen, but I'm going to try.  My mind is very unstable lately, as if I'm on the verge of a major shift in mindset and from this point things are critical.  I can see myself completely collapsing or rising up and this is the place where those roads diverge.  I want to find something creative and simple to work on, whether it be writing or remodeling my parents' house; something simple that i can focus most of my efforts on.  I'm tired with worrying how I look in other people's eyes, tired of being judged, tired of dealing with the stress of my work and the people I have to see on a daily basis.  I don't want to see any people that I don't have to, a funny thing to say for someone interested in sociology, but it's the truth.  I came down here to be surrounded by people and now I'm just sick of them.  Like going to the bar for a beer and instead you get smashed on tequilla.  I want to see my family and I want to love them, and I want to be in an environment that is caring and facilitates my desire to discover my convictions on my own and live by them, or at least move towards it more so than I have recently.  Last night, in response to that slogan on the brick in the wall I responded, with an anecdote, whether it was directed toward me or not.  It now reads, just below:
<b>&quot;No matter how much a wise ass pontificates he will never be more than a wise ass&quot;</b></p>

			 <p>I've been a bit worried as of late, worried for myself, maybe something that has never existed
Driving boxes of Midwestern roads I talk, sometimes in consolation, other times in desperation, wanting anything to turn out some solidarity. As the days persist I float through them, already tired, already somewhat dead, as if ghostly I pass from one day to the next, barely leaving a footprint, not seeing my reflection in people that I call friends.  Because the ones that used to reflect have now been spat upon and grow dilapidated in time, and in a way I do not any longer exist, but instead just keep returning to places and feelings that remind me of them, as if to see myself better, to construct some abstract creation of self that I'm not even certain I like, but it's an easy cop out to not following through with growing and creating something new.  On those same box roads I see out-of-state plates coming home on holiday and vacation, where I can just imagine their thoughts as they pull into the drive and take that deep breath before they unclench the steering wheel and unlock the heavily latched door to their old life, and step in.  And no matter their new lives, no matter their accomplishments and new relationships, no matter what new philosophies they have on life or volumes of information they've stuffed into their brains, they will always see an old reflection when home, &quot;in all their looks and words&quot;&hellip;though slightly stranger and more alien, with more creases in their face and a certain emptiness in the eyes.  It is those feelings and those looks that I see in my dreams, that I wake up thirty, forty, or fifty years old, excited to leave on holiday and forget my new life that I wanted so badly, to come home only to see those old reflections of myself that I loathe and love, that I had tried to forget and despised to see, with my new life huddled like an elephant in the room and the old like a ghost at the dinner table.  I'm terrified of this.</p>

			 <p>I had this bizarre dream last night.  It's funny because I don't normally remember my dreams, but this one stuck.</p>
<p>It started with me leaning against the bar in this dining area/ballroom, everyone decked out in tuxedos and gowns, chandeliers and everything else.  I was looking around and drinking my whiskey or whatever thinking how spectacular the place looked, but I wasn't in the greatest of moods.  I didn't want to be there.  At this point I looked over to this figure moving his way through the round tables toward one of the doors.  He looked over at me and I was surprised to see that it was my dad.  Not my step father, but the AWOL Bryan Sr.  We looked straight at one other&hellip;and we knew exactly who the other was&hellip;but he just kind of nodded, turned his head away, and kept walking.  I thought about it a second and then I was almost instantly wrought with madness.  How could he have done that?  I finished my drink and I headed for the door.  Following him out I see that he's quite a ways ahead of me&hellip;and he's climbing into this vehicle&hellip;almost like a dump truck or something&hellip;but far larger.  I don't even know how he got up there, it was just that large.   He was eating lunch when I approached him; evidently the ballroom food wasn't to his liking.  When he saw me he didn't even really say anything&hellip;just started sharing his lunch with me.  He handed me this huge slab of fish&hellip;bigger than my arm&hellip;and I started to eat it.  I don't eat seafood.</p>
<p>And when I woke I felt alone.</p>

			 <p>I'm dreading my return to Lansing.  I'm absolutely 100% tired of my roommates.  2/3rds of them are okay people, but the novelty of living with them has worn off and the whole thing has started to become kind of awkward.  I think it would suit me to get one of those studios, 5X5 with a kitchenette and bathroom and that's it.  Have everything I own in one room to save my concentration.  The truth of the matter is that I'm only living there because it's dirt cheap and I don't know exactly where I'm going to be in the fall, so a lease is out of the question.  I've actually thought about going back north for the seclusion; I kind of miss the country and the peace &amp; quiet (and my sanity).  But that probably won't happen.  I'm getting kind of too old for that?  Whatever.  But this song has me in a good mood and thinking happy thoughts so enough about this garbage!</p>

But the brakes were really bad and when I tried to slow down to take turns or stop for obstructions the car wouldn't stop&hellip;only slightly slow down when i put all of my weight into the brake; I'd just keep sliding&hellip;brakes screeching&hellip;and the steering wheel would slacken.

			 <p>What's the big deal with individuality?  If you ask me, it's more just a means to an end, a reason to draw lines around and/or between EVERYTHING.  I'm speaking of individuality, not to be mistaken for creativity.  Why are we always making up these boundaries about who we are and who we are not when most of the time this individualiaty is just dogma or stigma or hypocricy.  What is the desire, the positive outcome?  I'm not talking about that &quot;friends come in all sizes&quot; bullshit; I know, people are yellow and brown and fat and skinny, I'm not talking about making clones of everyone.  It's just that we try so hard to define ourselves, to constrict what our values and ideas and lifestyles and everything are.  It's just such a bunch of bologna.  Shit, I bet half of you probably spent 4 hours on your keywords for livejournal trying to create what you believe to be a good image of yourself to save face.  Lose a little face.  We're human.</p>

			 <p>I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I'm completely, utterly afraid of commitment, almost in all aspects of my life.  From who I am to who I want to be, to what I wear, to who sleeps in my bed with me, and the only things that stay constant in my life are fears and addictions.  Good Goddamn it feels awesome to be truthful with myself.  And now it's time to move towards the positive, to keep with the general flow as of late.  Thank you Rumi, once again, for your insight.
<br>
<br>
I've also come to realize that I have virtually no life at all.  This is good because I've had so much time to think that I'm actually figuring things out (kinda)!  I'm also learning a lot about history and early American Civilization, which is really opening my eyes to a lot of things.  I have a humanities class (AMERICAN CIVILIZATION), which the professor has taken as, &quot;HEY, let's have two hour discussions and write a paper every week about whatever we feel.&quot;  I've been coinciding our dates and history discussions with my reading of <u>A People's History of the United States</u> by Howard Zinn.  So far this has proved dynamic, and compliments one another quite perfectly.
P.S.  I think that becoming a Senator or Representative should literally be a <b>prison sentence</b>, where their sole job is a community service of holding that position.  That way we only get people that care so much about what needs to be done that they'll actually put up with being in prison to do what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
Today is also my second day of not smoking.  Yesterday was so much worse than today.  I'm still jittery, but it's probably from the coffee which  I needed to keep my hands busy.  I was a 1  pack a day smoker so that's at least 5 dollars a day in the Great Lakes State, or in other words $150 dollars a month.  Believe it or not, that extra $150 a month is going to help me so much.  I may actually be able to go away for spring break like I had been hoping to do  And my lungs, jeez, they have been so pissed at me!  Yesterday when I didn't smoke my mind said to my body, &quot;HEY YOU LITTLE FUCKER.  I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.  I CONTROL YOUR FUNCTioNS.  TODAY YOU WILL NOT FUNCTiON IF I DOn'T GET MY FIX!&quot;  But my lungs were screaming, &quot; HEY!  AIR?!?!  FRESH AIR?!?  THANKS, DUDE* &quot;.
<br>
<br>
<br>
*But fuck you for making me put up with this shit for so long.</p>

			 <p>Today is a beautiful day.  I love it when I rise with the sun, fully rested and in high spirits.  I've been taking a lot from my religious readings lately, especially Rumi&hellip;he makes me think these positive thoughts, feel these feelings that everything is in it's right place.  My posture is improving and the tension in my shoulders and brow are lessened by the day.  I think soon that I will have the willpower to quit smoking and then I'll be filled with energy in time for spring!</p>
<p>I haven't always been the best of people, I know this, for I often wore it on my sleeve as pessimism.  I have been trying to be more selfless.  Yesterday I was walking to my car, 5 blocks away from class, and while passing the parked cars along the way I saw the little parking ticket police vehicle cruising along, trying to snag someone.  I was about 2-3 car lengths ahead of her, and when I saw cars without minutes on the meter, I pumped in a coin for them.  I think she saw me and was actually mad!  Can you believe that!  I laughed at her and I laughed at myself.</p>

			 <P>I feel like I&apos;m a robot.&nbsp; Not in the trendy way, either.<BR>Routine. Zeep. Zip. Beep. Boink.<BR>And coaxing myself and others into thinking that I&apos;m strong isn&apos;t going to hold up much longer, I feel.&nbsp; The ruse is going to break.&nbsp; I&apos;d just like someone else to be strong for me for a couple of days.&nbsp; Maybe so I can just build my strength back up.&nbsp; Like how a diver needs to come up for air, or to refill his tank, or whatever.&nbsp; At risk of being pushed outside the realm of men I&apos;ll quite frankly state that I need someone to hold me in my bed without the relationship stresses or sex or whatever.&nbsp; Someone that just makes me feel like I&apos;m alive, that things are ok, and that there are people who care about me.&nbsp; As a reminder.&nbsp; Because I know these things are true, I just sometimes need to be reminded.&nbsp; Lately I haven&apos;t been reminded very often.</P>
<P>This winter has been damned dreary.&nbsp; It started out with a kick/hoorah, then it just kind of fizzled.&nbsp; The other day it was -30 with windchill.&nbsp; That&apos;s ok.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; I live in Michigan, I can deal with it.&nbsp; Then the snow.&nbsp; And the clouds that block out the life-giving sun.&nbsp; Then my dog Eddie Dies.&nbsp; The saddest little thing ever.&nbsp; But it&apos;s alright, he was sick, and it was his time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Then one of my Profs dropped my final grade from a 3.5 to a 3.0, not because I wasn&apos;t a good student, but because I missed some days of class.&nbsp; I outperformed virtually everyone in class and that bastard wants to play god??&nbsp; If you&apos;re reading this Dr, fuck you. I didn&apos;t go to class because you didn&apos;t teach me anything.&nbsp; The grades I get are from what I already know or from what I teach myself.&nbsp; Sad day when people pay all this money for a paper that says, &quot;Hey, I know how to show up!&quot;&nbsp; Whatever. I&apos;m a hypocrite, si.</P>
<P>And now Erica leaves for Hawaii in a week or so.&nbsp; The one person I&apos;ve connected with in over 2 years is now gone.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I&apos;ll follow her there.

			 <p>The last few days its been inhumanely cold. 0 degrees, 3 degrees, -4 degree windchill, etc.
today when i walked out the front door i bundled, but no gust blew me over.
It feels like it's thirty degrees and it almost feels like fucking spring after the REAL cold.</p>
<p>Today and yesterday were my days off, and I haven't had a pair of days off since august.  At first I almost felt dirty that I really didn't have anything that I should be doing.  I paced around.  Went to a matinee with shaun (Closer, only because The Life Aqauatic isn't here yet, damnit).  Drank myself to oblivion.  I really shouldnt have done that because my head is now aching to the sound of the keyboard clicks. clicks. clicks.</p>
<p>Hear that?  That's the sound of history repeating itself.</p>
<p>Benny burned me William Shatner's newish CD, which is played rather regularly now.  Surprisingly good.  Scary.
And for some reason I've been listening to old Brand New.  Oxymoron.  I'm losing it.  Anyway, it fits right in with winter.  Deja Entendu is a great album.</p>
<p>Ah, my island universe.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays</p>

			 <p>I've moved so much, and moving around is degenerative to my goal.  But the idea of a Hindi sannyasi has really been intriguing me lately.  I know I don't have the balls to just up and leave right now, but maybe if I was forced into a position where I had little to no material possessions, then I'd really have no choice.  I want to be more self-explorative.  Being soft with all of its distractions (e.g having a car, house, music, job, school) has a way of making you forgot about what it really means to be alive.  I always think about that one greasy spoon scene in Pulp Fiction when John Trevolta and Samual L are fighting over the fact that Trevolta wants to become a traveling holy man or whatever.  Samual proclaims that he'd be a bum if he did that.</p>
<p>Would I be a bum?
I don't think so.  I don't think bums try to better themselves spiritually in any way.  Maybe some do, but I'm thinking the vast majority are just people who couldn't get a grasp on their alcoholism, lost their jobs/homes, etc.  I bet if you handed them a million dollars, they wouldn't be on the streets anymore.
When the H.S. guidance counselor asks &quot;what kind of job would you do if you had a million dollars?&quot; no one ever says &quot;I want to be a sannyasi.&quot;  That's because the sannyasi needs nothing.  He especially does not need money.</p>
<p>I also noticed something today.  All the young people in the midwest are so uncertain.  The only thing they ARE certain about is that they're leaving.  But it's always <i>someday</i>. <i>tomorrow</i>. ma√±ana.  a lovely word, and one that probably means 'heaven'.  a heaven that will always be one day away.</p>
<p>But yes, I'd like to leave.  Maybe just a vacation.  If I could save up enough money to eat for the summer, maybe i could go.  I dunno.</p>

			 <P><FONT size=2>&quot;I have an existential map.&nbsp; It has &apos;you are here&apos; written all over it.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>-Stephen Wright</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=2>I used to have a friend that would tell me &apos;ignorance is bliss&apos;.&nbsp; He would then go on to describe his ideal circumstance in being blissfully ignorant, painting a picture of himself nearly comatose in a wheelchair on the front lawn of his home,&nbsp;watching the&nbsp;sprinkler go back and forth with unending interest as he lay drooling on himself.&nbsp; At the time&nbsp; we both thought that we were pretty smart people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoting books and reciting dry comedy, trying to one-up eachother with the newest record we had found, making sure to learn all the lyrics before showing it off.&nbsp; We were like sponges.&nbsp; Little asshole know-it-all sponges.&nbsp; The funny part about being a know-it-all is that you don&apos;t realize how naive you really are.&nbsp; You don&apos;t realize how much more there is to experience.&nbsp; You just go on thinking the way you do, in your own little world.&nbsp; With this I don&apos;t mean that we weren&apos;t open to experience.&nbsp; But what happens is that you start to get so engrained in patterns of thinking that you tend to not look beyond those views.&nbsp;&nbsp;Content with what you know.&nbsp; Comfortable.&nbsp; Confident.&nbsp; For example, we used to be so angry at organized religion.&nbsp; Not so much the religion itself but the people and their dogmas.&nbsp; Especially people who claimed and preached a particular religion. They who looked down their noses at people who were not like themselves, and then had the audacity to not follow their own convictions.&nbsp; The comedy of it all is that we were just as hypocritical as they.&nbsp; And we secretly looked down our noses at <EM>them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</EM>On a side note, this reminds me of something my friend Ashley once said to me:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>&quot;We all jerk off about how smart we are sometimes without there ever really being anything sexy about the idea.&quot;</FONT><BR></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Anyway, what I&apos;m getting at is that we were and&nbsp;still are&nbsp;very&nbsp;ignorant.&nbsp; The difference between the me of yesterday and myself of today is that&nbsp;I realize it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could&nbsp;never&nbsp;begin to imagine the scope, but that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t know it&apos;s there.&nbsp; I don&apos;t think there is such a thing as pure ignorance, so it&nbsp;must not be the key to bliss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even my dog has memory.&nbsp; And I&apos;m&nbsp;assuming that even at the level of retardation described above, one must be as egocentric as an infant, but also must know the displeasure of yearning for the unattainable.&nbsp;Even if those feelings can&apos;t be formulated into a way we can understand. (<EM>Why</EM>&nbsp;does the sprinkler go back and forth all day long?)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>What about love?&nbsp; Plato said that Love is nothing but the longing, and once you&apos;ve attained it, it is no longer love.&nbsp; I dunno. &nbsp;Zen?&nbsp; Meditation?&nbsp; Enlightenment?&nbsp; It&apos;s hard to maintain your composure when an SUV cuts off your compact on the highway.&nbsp; And unless I want to cut all ties to everything and everyone&nbsp;I know&nbsp;and hide away in the jungle (where I don&apos;t have to pay&nbsp;property taxes), I can&apos;t find these things very functional.&nbsp; Wait, forget everything I just said.&nbsp; I just found bliss.&nbsp; It involved a drive-thru, sit-com reruns and Tetris.&nbsp; And a nap.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>Goodnight.</FONT></P>

<p>instead, i bought a cd player wiring harness for ten bucks, did some fiddlin' and viola!  20 minutes later i have my cd player in my protege, which i've been driving for almost a month now with only NPR [and on good nights, MSU college radio].  i drove around for two hours just listening to some of the cd's i've aquired in the last three weeks.  man it feels good.  should have seen the moon and the clouds!  beautiful night. 66 degrees.  perfect.</p>

			 <p>But in the morning
on the sober dawn of Sunday
you're not sure what you have done
Who told you love was fleeting?
Sometimes men can be so misleading
to take what they need from you
Whatever you need to make you feel
like you've been the one behind the wheel
the sunrise is just over that hill
the worst is over
Whatever I said to make you think
that love's the religion of the weak
this morning we love like weaklings
the worst is over.</p>

<P>Monthly draft calls will increase from 17,000 to 35,000 - the highest level since the Korean War, when between 50,000 and 80,000 men were called up each month. 
<P>It will take the US force in Vietnam up to 125,000 but officials say at this stage demands should be met by conscription, without calling upon the reserves.

<P><FONT size=2>Speaking in a televised address from the White House President Johnson said: &quot;We do not want an expanding struggle with consequences no one can foresee.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Nor will we bluster, bully or flaunt our power. But we will not surrender, nor will we retreat,&quot; he continued. 
<P>The President gave the news conference after a week of intensive talks with senior military and security advisers in Washington. 
<P>He explained the decisions were in response to requests made by General Westmoreland, the US Commander in the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon. 
<P>Mrs Johnson and her daughter looked close to tears as Mr Johnson admitted: &quot;I do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth, our finest young men, into battle.&quot; 
<P>The US leader also made clear his desire for peace and recalled the - unsuccessful - efforts of 40 countries to bring an end to the fighting on 15 occasions. 
<P>He called upon the United Nations to redouble its efforts to restore peace to Vietnam and detailed a personal letter to that effect being personally delivered to the UN Secretary-General, U Thant, in New York by the new US Ambassador to the UN, Arthur Goldberg. 
<P>The Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, and the Secretary of Defence, Robert S McNamara, are to persuade Congress of the need to finance the US&apos; new military commitments, in the light of a reduced defence budget this year. 
<P>President Johnson explained: &quot;We intend to convince the communists that we cannot be defeated by force of arms or by superior power.&quot; </P>

<P>Six of them were sentenced to death and five to life in prison in the biggest single baby trafficking case in recent Chinese history. 
<P>Over a two-year period the smuggling ring is thought to have bought and sold 118 babies, many of them girls. 
<P>It was unmasked last year when police boarded a bus in south-west China and found 28 babies stuffed inside travel bags. One had died from the cold. 
<P>To outsiders it is a shocking trade, but in rural China it is ancient and it is growing. 
<P>It is driven by China&apos;s strict family planning laws which limit many couples to one child. 
<P>Desperate for a boy, farmers often sell a baby girl before its birth can be registered. Ironically, the baby will often be sold to other poor farmers as a future bride for their son.

			 <p>has anyone really mastered the art of being alive?  with this i mean, to live entirely unscathed by the world around them no matter how grim it may look.  i figure there are two ways in which people may do this.  theres the grabbing-life-by-the-balls-and-twisting type of lifestyle and then theres the passive, let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may, happy-go-lucky lifestyle.  between those two realms must lie a huge gap that many people fall into.  whether it be keeping up with the jones' or being immersed in loneliness, people snuggle confortably with routine. addictively safe settings in which they live out their lives practically comatose.</p>
<p>at night i listen to jazz on npr and drive around.  i wind through the countryside, along the rivers, around blocks of corn and wheat and i just chill.  it's my time to collect myself.  sometimes i stop to watch deer in the fields or look up at the stars.  other times i just drive and look at houses, crazed by the number of dull-blue windows there are.  all those people glued to their television sets.  sure, sometimes i'm no better.  i can hang with the best of them online.  i get lonely sometimes being way out here in no man's land.  not having anyone similar near me is kind of intimidating at times.  but for the most part i think i'm really happy.  as for the previously stated opinions on mastering life, no, i haven't pinned it down.  but i think i fall closer to the latter of the two.  things change.  i'm content with that.  i like things to get stirred up a bit.  people move away, people change.  things die, others are born.  renewal.  keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>but what i really wonder about are all those people that have lost all curiosity for life.  they replace thought with religion, put way too much emphasis on their own beliefs instead of respecting others', and get far too caught up in material things.  with this i think they sacrifice their lives.  what we are made to do they somehow ignore when 'everybody loves raymond' comes on. or when they are forced to have an opinion, they always take the safe approach [maybe as to not be ostracized by the church? or be tagged anit-american?].  i am not saying that i am perfect.  i'm just saying that i'm curious.  i'm mostly light-hearted, too.  why is everyone so serious?  why is everyone so seriously dull?</p>

			 <p>the von bondies, lack of communication has been on repeat.</p>
<p>i ccan feel my life slowing down like a top that's lost all its momentum.  for the first time since i can remember, i think i'm okay with that.  ties are cut, bridges have been burned, new roadways [being] built.  trying to focus on my next few steps instead of looking so far into the haze that i don't realize the life around me.  it's been that way for far too long.</p>
<p>i want to buy a house&hellip;and i want to channel all my creative energy into it..fixing it up and put a little studio in the basement for no one but myself and my closest.  so i shall start saving money.  just put it away and not think about it so when i'm READY, it'll be there.</p>
<p>i'm moving into a townhouse real quick here, within the next few weeks.  my roomates have already signed the papers&hellip;i just got to get down to lansing and sign 'em.  and look for a new job&hellip;</p>
<p>another change in my life to look back on.  but i have a feeling this one will be hugely positive.</p>

			 <p>I canceled my Sprint account. Time to start saving an extra sixty-two dollars a month.  At the end of this month you will only be able to reach me at my home or by e-mail.  I figured it was about time to start saving some money, seriously.  I kind of like the idea of being somewhat disconnected anyway.</p>
<p>Today I woke up and decided I was going to donate plasma.
On the way I stopped by work to request next weekend off so I can go up to Sleeping Bear Dunes/Lake Michigan for some rustic camping with Jonathan and crew&hellip;much to my surprise, I actually got the weekend off.  One last attempt at a good time this summer.</p>
<p>As for the plasma donation:</p>
<p>I spent about 3 hours getting set up with tests and paper work and waiting and getting hooked up to a machine that sucked my blood out, extracted my plasma, and then pumped my red blood cells back into my body.  It went throught this cycle about 12 times while I watched the clock and read a rolling stone I found in the waiting room&hellip;laughing at the sorry excuses for critique and wondering why they call it 'donating plasma' when they pay you to do it.  All in all it wasn't so bad, althought a little tedious pumping my arm and watching the container slowly fill with a funny yellow substance that came from my body.  When I was done I didn't feel too bad.  I was just a little bit dizzy, but i got my 25 bucks cash and continued to my car. I got on the expressway, at which point I started to feel really sick.  I hadn't eaten anything all day and I'm guessing that's not a good thing to do when you're having fluids taken from you.  I stopped at a gas station in Alma to put something in me, and I made it to the bathroom in time as to not pass out in public.  But regaining consciousness on a gas station's bathroom floor with your face near the toilet isn't exactly what I consider a good time, either.  I got up and drank from the sink&hellip;gulps and gulps.  Bought two Gatoraids and drank to my heart's content in the parking lot while 'you can't always get what you want' by the Stones came on the radio.  I felt better after about 15 minutes, but I'll be sure next time to eat something before I do anything like that again.</p>
<p>So in combination, between the cell phone and the plasma I'm up $87 minus $3 for Gatoraid = $84.  I'm going to try and not blow it on music.</p>

			 <p>why i was not aborted, i do not know.  bryan barry robb II, born to bryan barry robb sr. and deborah lynn barnette-robb on the 20th day of february, 1981.  my mom was a strong woman.  gave birth to me at 19.  she gave up her full-ride to nursing school and we lived in a motel in detroit because my dad wouldn't get a job.  my mom walked the streets of detroit in order to find a job to support us while she was pregnant for my brother.  she gave birth to my brother bradley at 21.  at which point my father split [never paid a dime] and from then on she raised us herself, worked full-time, and still managed to get her assosiates degree [without the full-ride].  and never did i feel unloved.  she smothered us in love.</p>
<p>then in '86 she had a new boyfriend named jim.  he had money but he liked to spend it on booze and gambling.  the first words he ever spoke to me were 'chew with your mouth shut' while i was eating my corn pops cereal.  as if he knew etiquette.  i may be wrong, but i'm pretty sure good etiquette doesn't involve taking a girl and her two young children to the casino and laying her in a hotel bed while the two children hide under the covers and plug their ears in the bed beside.  he would beat us.  he would cheat on her and come home drunk.  if we did something 'wrong', he'd make us get in the push-up position and pile phone books on our backs while we held that up-right position for long periods of time while he sat on the couch and watched HBO. and if we dropped the phone books from our backs, the clock started over again.  i remember once my brother and i were playing in the drive way. jimmy [jims eldest son] jumped in the car and started backing up in his camaro and roled right over my little brother.  ran him over with the tire.  it's a miracle he wasn't killed, but i guess he was in a sandy area so he didn't get more than a few scratches. jimmy picks brad up and runs him into the house and a little while later jim comes out, grabs me by the arm and starts beating me because I [yes, me, 5 year old bryan] DID NOT TELL JIMMY THAT BRAD WAS BEHIND THE CAR.  yeah, my mom put up with a lot of shit because she didn't have anywhere to turn.</p>
<p>i, on the other hand, don't know why i exist.  i say i have troubles but i do not know troubles.  i have it easy.</p>
<p>but then why do things seem hard?  why is my complete lack of inspiration for living not subsiding?  she always tells me 'you do what you have to do.  having children shocks you into reality i guess'.  you'd think having her as an influence and positive force in my life for so long that i would have learned something from it.  maybe i am learning now, but i'm 23.  i'm going to school and working but i still feel like i'm doing the bare minimum.  i'm not 'conquering life' so to speak.  sometimes going to the post office is an eventful day for me.  i'm thankfully off drugs but sometimes when i look back at who i used to be, i miss myself, because it seems like i was such a lovely, creative person then.  i had emotion and i had fun.  now i do not have fun, even doing things i used to love.</p>
<p>i went back to detroit with jonathan this weekend to visit my friend pelot.  he got a beautiful new place in midtown. we went to a few bars and acted crazy and had a few laughs, but it was nothing like it used to be.  while driving around seeing the littered streets of mexican town and the abandoned buildings of cork town, all i could think about was my mother, walking those streets to find a job to support me.  worn out old motels that rent hourly, nightly and weekly. hotels that were probably not too much unlike my first home. hookers and crack heads.  steam coming from the man holes.</p>
<p>shit, i got it easy.  what the fuck's wrong?</p>

The Tower
Position: Self
Main (positional) Meaning:
Significant change is brought about rapidly and unexpectedly.
<lj-cut>
<p>The card in the Self position reveals aspects of how you perceive yourself right now.</p>
<p>The Tower represents a rapid, creative charge that is unplanned and uncontrollable but presents a brilliant opportunity for transformation. Because of circumstances beyond your control, you have no choice.</p>
<p>Try not to judge whether this development is good or bad. You won't know for awhile whether this was the worst disaster that ever happened or a significant breakthrough. It could be a combination of both.</p>
<img src=&quot;[gfx.tarot.com/images/de...](http://gfx.tarot.com/images/decks/cary_yale_visconti/full_size/65.jpg&quot;)>
Two of Coins
Position: Situation
Main (positional) Meaning:
Resist the impulse to join those around you who are becoming polarized in opposing camps.
<p>The card that lands in the Situation position refers to social or circumstantial factors which could be affecting your life at this time.</p>
<p>When the Two of Coins is in this position, you may be surrounded by people who are busy taking sides. If so, resist the impulse to join either camp. Some people with a need to be in control may jump to conclusions. You do not have to join them, however, or take a position one way or the other.</p>
<p>Ask yourself &ndash; are all the facts in yet? Or do unknowns still govern the day? If you are patient, you will spare yourself grief, while truth reveals itself in its own good time. Don't let fear have its way with you &ndash; you may discover the situation was never as serious as it seemed.</p>
<img src=&quot;[gfx.tarot.com/images/de...](http://gfx.tarot.com/images/decks/cary_yale_visconti/full_size/62.jpg&quot;)>
<p>Queen of Swords
Position: Challenges/ Opportunities
Main (positional) Meaning:
Champion your own needs; put some distance between yourself and those who would hamper your progress.</p>
<p>The card that lands in the Challenges/Opportunities position refers to ways that you can turn obstacles into stepping stones.</p>
<p>With the Queen of Swords in this position, improve your ability to balance your needs against the pressures of other people's expectations. To turn this challenge into an opportunity, develop some enthusiasm for spending more time with yourself, making the pivotal decisions in your own life, and living directly with the consequences of your choices.</p>
<p>Become your own best advocate. To help you accomplish this goal, shorten the list of people and circumstances that have the power to distract you or divert your energy. Define your boundaries. State your goals. Start acting on your own behalf.</p>

			 <p>it's funny how you don't realize something until someone brings it to your attention and from that moment on you never look at it in the same light again.  it could be something you've taken for granted or just something you've never even noticed.  a material object or a figure of speech or even your own personality.  and suddenly you can't help but notice it.  your thought pattern completely changes from that moment on.  i guess this would be the definition of epiphany.</p>

			 <p>my car died yesterday.  it was sad to see leon the neon on the side of the road, smoking out of the hood.  but i just sat on the trunk and looked at the open fields and the clouds and waited for the wrecker.  it's events like this that make me happy that i have family around to help. if i move to some distant corner of the globe, i'd be completely alone and things like this would have to be dealt with entirely on my own.  when the wrecker came he just hooked a chain up to the front and pulled me a couple miles down the road to a mechanic.  i got to steer my car while he pulled and it was kind of fun.  poor car. we've been through a lot together.  i know it's ugly as sin and it's probably the worst car on the road, but it has lasted so long despite so much tragedy.  twice i packed all of my belongings into that thing and risked mountain passes, snow, lightning, wind, deer&hellip;traveled cross-country when it had no business doing so&hellip;pushed it to the limit and it rarely let me down.  so many memories.  trips to the beach. love making.  the music that has been through those speakers&hellip;even the tiny hint of makeup that's still on the visor from when angie used to use the little mirror for applications on the fly.

			 <p><i>I'm sorry that you are feeling so depressed and I'm sorry if I contribute to that.  My life has more or less been spent raising you guys.  Quite a bit of that time by myself, which didn't leave a whole lot of time for hobbies.  Now that you guys are grown up and I have more time to focus on myself, I find that I don't know what to do with myself.  Maybe that is part of the reason I feel depressed sometimes.  Because the whole purpose of my life and existence for the last 23 years was you guys and now you don't need me anymore.</p>
<p>I know I haven't always been the greatest mother.  I've never been a great cook and Lord knows I've not been a great housekeeper.  But nevertheless, I have tried to be a good mom in other ways.  I don't think you guys have ever felt unloved by me, have you?</p>
<p>I don't know how to help you feel better other than to tell you I'm very proud of you right now.  Brian is, too.  You took a little detour for a couple years, which set you back maybe a little bit from some of the other people your age, but lots of people do that, including me.  I did the same thing and I didn't turn out too bad, did I?  My life is a little boring, but when you get older you reach a point were life is just comfortable.  I guess having so many ups and downs in my life with my dad and step dad, your dad and Jim, that at this point in my life I am just thankful my life has settled down and I don't have to go through any of that craziness anymore.</p>
<p>My life was always in so much turmoil, it just feels to be able to relax and not be worried all the time.  I hope you can understand this.</p>
<p>But back to you.  So you took a little detour for a while.  It's not the end of the world.  The important thing is that hopefully you've learned from your mistakes and you are making an effort to correct them.  Just be patient.  Your day to shine will come and all your hard work will pay off.  I have faith in you.  I know what you are capable of and I hope one day you will put us all to shame with what you've achieved.  Nothing could make me happier as a mother than to see all my kids succeed in life, and I know you will.  Be patient.  Appreciate the good things in your life and try not to focus on what's bad.  You are an extremely intelligent young man and you have a lot to be thankful for.  Just keep doing like you are doing now.  You are headed in the right direction.  Tomorrow will look brighter, it always does.</p>
<p>I love you!
MOM</i></p>

			 <p>good goddamn.</p>
<p>i love it how when the pistons beat the pacers, everyone was like &quot;now you get to see the pistons get murdered by the lakers&quot;</p>
<p>and what did we do?</p>
<p>we won game one @ LA</p>
<p>We came &quot;this close&quot; to winning game two in LA, if it weren't for bryant's miracle shot to put us into over time.</p>
<p>and guess what happened tonight in game three?
Pistons 88, Lakers 68.</p>
<p>for all of you that know me, i'm not huge into sports, but i've always had a soft spot for the pistons, if only as one of the few bonding mechanisms between me and my step dad.  and it's exciting to see them actually have a decent team, and a chance to win it all for the first time in 13 years.  the bad boys are back.</p>
<p>oh, and what was that shit jimmy kimmel was talkin after the last game?  'the fans will burn detroit if they don't win&quot;</p>
<p>i'm sick and tired of detroit getting such a bad wrap.  it's really a kick ass town, and considering the hell it's gone through, i think it's doubly great.  most people that talk the shit haven't ever even been there.</p>

			 <p>our 'success' is founded on a base of our species' compilation of knowledge from a time since passed.</p>
<p>without surplus, there can be no inequality.</p>
<p>when you eliminate 'self', there are no boundaries.</p>
<p>our adaptability as a species is our greatest asset AND our greatest downfall.  it's helped us to survive, but it also makes us take for granted the sweetest of things.</p>

			 <p>I don't like giving up on people, I really don't.  When people hang by a thread, I try my best to reinforce it,  best I can.  I call people out of the blue to see if they're still alive.  I go out of my way to drive to peoples' places, all over the damn state.  Hell, I was the only person who called Nathan regularly after he was sent to Germany, and I wasn't even his closest friend.  But do people ever call me out of the blue?  Very rarely.  Who went to your birthday party?  Me.  Who even so much as called me on mine?  When was the last time anyone came to my house?  Years?  Sure, distance and time is a factor.  I live out in the middle of nowhere.  But has that stopped me from visiting people everywhere, from Kalamazoo to Lansing, to Detroit, to Chicago, to Sault St. Marie?  No.  And I'm the least likely to have the money for the trip&hellip;and I most definitely have the most unreliable vehicle.  But I don't care.  Even my closest friends never come out here.  They complain when they have to drive 20 minutes out to my place.  Yet, like clockwork, I drive my ass to their places a few times a week.  It's not like anything particularly more interesting ever happens at their places, I just always go.</p>
<p>I'm kind of getting sick of peoples' apathy.  And everyone being so egocentric.  People not taking the time to listen.  People always trying to get in the last word.  People looking down their noses at me.  People taking me for granted.</p>
<p>If I disappear, who'll notice?</p>

<p>today, today.  before today i'd never been in a funeral procession.  are you supposed to laugh?  because we did.  we joked about life.  we made cracks at the people watching us from their porches.  we laughed at the people at the intersections,  sitting bewildered and pissed as our 3 mile long funeral procession stopped most of lansing.  everyone eager to get home from the office, or to mcdonalds, or the airport, whatever.  we laughed really hard at the guy that was so pissed, he decided to cut right through us all, who immediately got pulled over by a cop on a harley, and was bitched out so loudly, we almost peed.  i was fine until the 21 gun salute and that lonely trumpet that they play at military funerals.  then i was struck with the biggest emptiness of my life.  surrounded by friends, i've never felt more disconnected than i did and still do right now.  this album almost killed me today. and then it saved my life.</p>

			 <p>Hrm, the sounds of last summer are starting to be recirculated.  Anyone know what I'm talking about?  Of course there are cd's that you listen to, that compliment the mood you're already in, but theres just certain songs or albums that make me feel a certain way.  I usually tuck them away for safe keeping, for those times when I think they'll be therapeutic.  Summer is weird though.  Only some albums are strictly summer albums.  Albums that remind me of good times, hell, even bad times that somehow look sweeter looking back.</p>
<p>So it's June already.  One month ago I was frying in the desert, worried how the semester would end, wondering how things would get done.  Well everything got done.  Now all I have is work.  I've been kind of looking for a place in Lansing.  Originally the plan was to move down with my friend Trevor and his buddy Tyler.  Tyler was in the coast guard and he got a housing allowance.  So I figured they'd be okay by themselves and began looking for a place with my old roommate, Adam,  from my first year of college at Michigan State.  He's still one of my good friends.  One of those friends that I don't necessarily see all the time, but when we get the chance to hang out, we really just clique.  Well as it turns out, Tyler dropped out on Trevor, so Trevor is sorta up shit creek without a paddle.  I'd like to help him out but he doesn't seem to be showing much initiative to sign up for classes, look for a place to live, etc.  For example, last week I said I'd take him in and get him registered for classes.  We planned for Tuesday to be the day [yesterday], and he'd take the day off work.  Well yesterday morning I get up extra early [for me, about 8am], But when I tried calling, he wasn't answering.  So I go over there and he'd gone to work.  He could have taken the day off because he works for his family.  So basically I took a day off for nothing [and I could really use the money] and scrapped other plans to do this FOR HIM.  He's been nothing but a good friend to me and has helped me out so much and I know we'd be good roomies but I don't like this flaking out shit.  So I really don't know who I should be getting a place with&hellip;someone who is going to have a positive influence on my lifestyle or someone who I've been a little hellion with for years.  Guess I'll figure it out, but it's gotta be soon.</p>
<p>OH yeah, did I mention I'm broke because they CUT my hours after school ended?  Make checks payable to Bryan Robb. XO  I love this shit.</p>

			 <p>hi.</p>
<p>guess i haven't updated in a while.
i've been feeling weird since i got back from california.
i don't feel like the same person anymore.</p>
<p>about the only thing of interest lately is that i finally got my grades back for the semester and it looks like i'll probably get into UM.  the only problem is i don't know how i'm going to pay for it.  maybe i should just quit and join the circus or something.</p>
<p>peace.</p>

			 <p>whoa, i'm just totally worn out.  i've decided to not go to class today and just stick around here.  i've caught up on some lost sleep and maybe now i can actually get some things done that probably should have been long ago.</p>
<p>so the other day my mom went into the hospital for surgery, which wasn't a horribly big deal, but when i went in to visit her i just couldn't help but think about what's to come in my relationship with my parents.  pretty soon this is going to happen more and more frequently and i'll be totally helpless&hellip;i'll just have to watch it all happen, just as they had with their parents.  i had dinner with my dad in the hospital's cafe and i could hardly even force myself to talk.  i caught myself just staring out the atrium windows and looking around at the other families, wondering what trauma they were going through.  i guess i've always been a bit naive in understanding why people hated hospitals so much.  i mean it should be obvious, but i guess since i've never really had to deal with anyone being in the hospital before&hellip;and my mother working in the medical field, that i just viewed a hospital as a workplace [at least when i was younger].  a place where people get better.  but people don't always get better.  i could just see it in the people's eyes in the lobby and on the elevator.  that distance in their eyes that says 'this is it', wearing looks on their faces that tell of their desperation while holding onto whatever last shred of hope that could be left.</p>
<p>after dinner i went back up to my mom's room and kissed her on the cheek.  she asked me to take her for a short walk because the doctor said she needed to be up and moving a few times a day.  so we walked down the hall, me holding her arm for stability.  i know she could sense my uneasiness: my mom and i have a connection [as i'm sure is the case in many parent-child relationships].  sometimes i hate it when she knows what i'm thinking.  especially when it's sadness.</p>
<p>when we got back to her bed i kissed her goodbye, told her i loved her and to get some rest.   i drove up and down orchard drive and main street near revere park just looking at all the old houses, some of which are almost two hundred years old.  absolutely magnificent houses that people have completely restored.  houses of previous big wigs like the Dows and others.</p>
<p>driving always seems to help me find myself a little bit.  as i drove i gazed at the houses and enjoyed their character and beauty.  no, they won't be here forever, but somebody obviously put some time and love into those places to help them shine just a little bit longer. so their character could awe us for some time.    and like those houses, we ourselves are built; with a limited amount of time to make our mark.  but it's enough time to turn a few heads, inspire a few minds and fill a few hearts with love.  and in this unpoetic analogy i found ease.</p>
<p>the next day when i got home from school late, i found a sealed envelop from my mom with a card inside thanking me for visiting her and telling me of how much she loved me.  yes, my mother has most definitely touched my life.  <em>thanks mom</em></p>

			 <p>I can't believe it's almost been a year since I moved home from Florida.</p>
<p>I haven't been single for this long since I started dating.  of course I've had pseudo relationships/encounters; nothing serious, and it's really starting to be a drag.  it's not that I haven't had opportunities with people, I'm just not moved by anyone recently.   and physical attraction only goes so far. this pond is far too small.   the only person I've even made a hard core connection with [imo, anyway&hellip;don't know if it was reciprocal] is Ashley [are you reading this?&ndash;you really touched me&hellip;and I'm extraordinarily grateful having met you.  and I'm happy that you're happy with your current situation! [hi Ryan]].</p>
<p>lately I've been thinking about how it's going to feel when I finally settle down.  stop partying on the weekends and just relax.  really focus on myself&hellip;maybe write a lot or make music.  not with the intent of public success&hellip;but just for ME.  also, focus more on my spirituality.  really delve into the matter and LIVE it.</p>
<p>I think of maybe living alone in a small house in the country with a stone-fenced backyard and a garden.  my little bedroom and modest library.  my fireplace and my ottoman.  everything in its right place&ndash;nothing special to anyone else&ndash;just me.  I think I'm ready for that.  Even if I'm not doing the job of my dreams.  I'll just have my own little section of the universe where I can live and be content and then die.  it's so romantic to me.  it just seems right.</p>

			 <p>i should seriously ask my anthropolgy teacher out on a date or somethin'
i can't walk into the room without hearing <i>hot for teacher</i> by van halen.
and my soc teacher is so goofy but i like the guy a lot.  he can't be much more than 2 or 3 years older than me.  today in that class, anna and me were arguing with this ultraconservative, some 40 somethin' lady in my class.  only today, instead of our team shouting marx and hers shouting functionalism, today we spat blood about the patriot act. she kept yelling out nonsensical points that she was obviously ill-informed about, and the prof was disagreeing with her in the politest of ways.  she made a couple valid points, but even a clock is right two times a day.  i had a good time though because that is actually a topic i know quite a bit about and i felt my arguments were clear, to the point, and reasonably well supported.  it's cool because the prof. is on my side.  he's helping me with my scholarship.
in other news, i sport-fucked my astronomy exam.  well, i think anyway.  i either did pretty damn well or i'm just completely disillusioned.  we'll see i guess.</p>
<p><b>this semester needs to end.</b></p>
<p>coachella is in like two and a half weeks.  a few things haven't quite worked out in that department.  the van idea is completely out the window.  hell, driving is completely out the window because i have a soc exam the thursday before that weekend.  gabe may still drive with the gals but trevor and i are going to fly out of chicago friday night to LAX&hellip;and somehow get from there to Indio.  maybe we can hitch hike.  we'll probably have to rent a car.  anyway, the trip is going to be a lot less hectic this way, even though i'm a little disappointed that i won't get to drive across the states again.  maybe at the end of the summer.  first things first.  stupid finals are the week after coachella.  damn school.</p>
<p>anyone who lives far away from michigan:  know of any good-paying summer jobs in your area?  preferably somewhere warm, ex: san diego, tampa/st. pete, atlanta&hellip;all you southern fools?  let me know, i need out.</p>

now there is no triumphant clause.  no daydream memorandum.  all is trite.

washes of gray and gold on walls from sunlight filtered through cloth haze.
words from voices that are not my own
words that make bad singing sweet.
and despite their sweetness contain no benevolence.</p>
<p>life has not been so succinctly self.
i have participated as three witnesses:
first, the barer of bad news.  sinister and childish, where the only growth is cancerous.
next, the insecure.  who has tasted truth, but remains disillusioned by the first.
finally, the other-worldly euphoria that floats in clouds, stair less and without law.

&quot;Children cheered while bodies burned after an attack on American civilians working for Blackwater Security Consulting of Moyock, N.C&quot;

&quot;Iraqis chanted anti-American slogans in Falluja yesterday as burned bodies of Americans were suspended on a bridge over the Euphrates River.&quot;
<p>FALLUJA, Iraq, March 31 ‚Äî Four Americans working for a security company were ambushed and killed Wednesday, and an enraged mob then jubilantly dragged the burned bodies through the streets of downtown Falluja, hanging at least two corpses from a bridge over the Euphrates River.</p>
<p>Less than 15 miles away, in the same area of the increasingly violent Sunni Triangle, five American soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb ripped through their armored personnel carrier.</p>
<p>The violence was one of the most brutal outbursts of anti-American rage since the war in Iraq began more than a year ago. And the steadily deteriorating situation in the Falluja area, a center of anti-American hostility west of Baghdad, has become so precarious that no American or Iraqi forces responded to the attack against the civilians, who worked for a North Carolina company.</p>
<p>American officials said the civilians were traveling in two sport utility vehicles although some witnesses in Falluja said there were four. &quot;Two got away; two got trapped,&quot; said Muhammad Furhan, a taxi driver.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the four Americans were doing in Falluja or where they were going. But just as they were passing a strip of stationery stores and kebab shops around 10:30 a.m., masked gunmen jumped into the street and blasted their vehicles with assault rifles. Witnesses said the civilians did not shoot back.</p>
<p>There are a number of police stations in Falluja and a base of more than 4,000 marines nearby, but even as the security guards were being swarmed and their vehicles set on fire, sending plumes of inky smoke over the closed shops of the city, there were no ambulances, no fire engines and no assistance.</p>
<p>Instead, Falluja's streets were thick with men and boys and chaos.</p>
<p>Men with scarves over their faces hurled bricks into the blazing vehicles. A group of boys yanked a smoldering body into the street and ripped it apart. Someone then tied a chunk of flesh to a rock and tossed it over a telephone wire.</p>
<p>&quot;Viva mujahedeen!&quot; shouted Said Khalaf, a taxi driver. &quot;Long live the resistance!&quot;</p>
<p>Nearby, a boy no older than 10 ground his heel into a burned head. &quot;Where is Bush?&quot; the boy yelled. &quot;Let him come here and see this!&quot;</p>
<p>Masked men gathered around him, punching their fists into the air. The streets filled with hundreds of people. &quot;Falluja is the graveyard of Americans!&quot; they chanted.</p>
<p>Several news crews filmed the mayhem. The images of a frenzied crowd mutilating bodies were reminiscent of the scene from Somalia in 1993, when a mob dragged the body of an American soldier through the streets of Mogadishu. That moment shifted public opinion and eventually led to an American pullout.</p>
<p>The White House blamed terrorists and remnants of Saddam Hussein's former government for the attack. &quot;This is a despicable attack,&quot; Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, told reporters, adding that &quot;there are some that are doing everything they can to prevent&quot; a transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government on June 30.</p>
<p>American military officials said the violence in Falluja, however chilling, would not scare them away. &quot;The insurgents in Falluja are testing us,&quot; said Capt. Chris Logan, a marine. &quot;They're testing our resolve. But it's not like we're going to leave. We just got here.&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Logan, who is stationed at a large walled base on the outskirts of the city, said Falluja was becoming &quot;an area of greater concern.&quot; Last week, a contingent of marines, who recently took over responsibility for Falluja from the Army, fought gunmen in a battle in which one marine, a television cameraman and several Iraqi civilians were killed.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of those areas in Iraq that is definitely squirrelly,&quot; Captain Logan said.</p>
<p>Many people in Falluja said they believed that they had won an important victory on Wednesday. They insisted that the four security guards, who were driving in unmarked sport utility vehicles, were working for the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what these spies deserve,&quot; said Salam Aldulayme, a 28-year-old Falluja resident.</p>
<p>Intelligence sources in Washington said the four were not working for the C.I.A. They worked for Blackwater Security Consulting of Moyock, N.C., providing security for food delivery in the Falluja area, according to a statement from the company. The occupation authorities have hired hundreds of private security guards for a range of duties.</p>
<p>Witnesses in Falluja said several of the men had Defense Department badges, though such identification is common for contractors working for the occupation. A senior military officer said the four were retired Special Operations forces ‚Äî three Navy Seals and one Army Ranger. American officials declined to immediately identify the dead men.</p>
<p>In the last three weeks, more than 10 foreign civilians have been killed in Iraq, though no attack provoked the spasm of brutality that followed this one.</p>
<p>Since the war in Iraq began, Falluja has been a flash point of violence. Of all the places in Iraq, it is where anti-American hatred is the strongest. The area is predominantly Sunni Muslim. Many families remain loyal to the captured dictator, Mr. Hussein, who is also a Sunni Muslim. Over the years, Mr. Hussein cultivated a network of patronage and privilege among the tribes and elders of Falluja. Many became top army officers. Some ran big companies. When Mr. Hussein was ousted last April, the people here lost their jobs, their businesses and their power.</p>
<p>That set off a cycle of killing and responses, a bloody feud between a clannish society and occupiers from thousands of miles away. Last April, American soldiers killed more than 15 civilians at a demonstration in Falluja. In November, an American helicopter was shot down outside the town, killing 16. Townspeople danced on the wreckage.</p>
<p>In February, insurgents mounted a brazen daylight attack against a convoy carrying Gen. John P. Abizaid, the American commander in the Middle East. He escaped unscathed. But two days later, gunmen blasted their way into a Falluja jail, killing at least 15 police officers and freeing dozens of prisoners.</p>
<p>Last week, the First Marine Expeditionary Force formally took control of the city, population 300,000, which sits on a desert shelf about 35 miles west of Baghdad. Marine commanders said they were going to try a different approach from the Army, which had basically pulled back to bases ringing Falluja and left policing up to the locals.</p>
<p>&quot;We're doing work outside the wire,&quot; Captain Logan said. &quot;We're running patrols. We're rebuilding things. We're working with Iraqis.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the Sunni Triangle, north and west of Baghdad, has become so unsafe that American forces stick to their bases, their movement usually limited to heavily guarded convoys.</p>
<p>Around 7 a.m. on Wednesday, an Army convoy passing through the town of Habbaniya, west of Falluja, rolled over an I.E.D., or improvised explosive device. The bomb was buried in the road and blew up under an armored personnel carrier, killing five soldiers. Roadside bombs are everyday occurrences in Iraq. But few have claimed as many casualties. &quot;It was a very large I.E.D.,&quot; said Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy operations director for the occupation forces.</p>
<p>A few hours later the men from Blackwater Security drove into downtown Falluja. After they were shot, the scene turned grisly. A crowd of more than 300 people flooded into the streets. Men swarmed around the vehicles. Some witnesses said the Americans were still alive when one boy came running up with a jug of gasoline. Soon, both vehicles were fireballs.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody here is happy with this,&quot; Mr. Furhan, the taxi driver, said. &quot;There is no question.&quot;</p>
<p>After the fires cooled, a group of boys tore the corpses out of the vehicles. The crowd cheered them on. The boys dragged the blackened bodies to the iron bridge over the Euphrates River, about a mile away. Some people said they saw four bodies hanging over the water, some said only two. At sunset, nurses from a nearby hospital tried to take the bodies away.</p>
<p>Men with guns threatened to kill the nurses. The nurses left. The bodies remained.</p>

<p>if you don't buy the album - &quot;Sufjan Stevens - Greetings from Michigan!  The great lake state&quot;  you are a huge boner.  It's from last year.</p>
<p>his new album is called 'Seven Swans&quot;.</p>
<p>if you have any doubts, just read a few of the reviews on amazon.  only one person out of 20 rated it lower than a 5 [out of 5] and the one review lower than that was probably written by a jealous sibling.</p>

			 <p>perhaps it's time for a real update.
i've actually been a real busy-body for the first time in ages.  i mean, holy shit, i was up at 5:30 today&hellip;without an alarm clock&mdash;-[need someone say&ndash;'who the fuck are you and what have you done with bryan'?]
in the beginning there were seeds.
so last month started out on a low note, coming to grips with the fact that i was going to be 23, a mere 7 years from 30.  THAT'S 3 DECADES.
i'd see kids from school that have graduated&hellip;.that were middle-schoolers when i was graduating.  i was almost </i>jealous<i> of them.  i wanted to be 17 again, going to shows every weekend, racking miles on my car, and getting caught up in youth drama.  i wanted good grades without having to  try&hellip;and thus the support that came along with that.  i wanted the ignorant love i had then&mdash;gosh it was beautiful.  yes, early February brought with it nausea, drinking binges, and puking fits.
shortly after this, brad came home from iraq&hellip;and i actually felt a bit better.  i actually connected with him&hellip;not just superficial lip service like it's been the last few years.  we drank while playing euchre, talked about life, about when we were kids, about the war, about his new wife to be, and whatever else&hellip;
and then my kid brother got married, the Wednesday before my birthday.  i was exceptionally happy for both of them, and i think they're a good match.  but i almost felt as if i failed&hellip;that my kid brother, [who had little personality&hellip;who got poor grades&hellip;.who has never been much of a success&hellip;..never showed much interest in anything&hellip;whom my parents were worried for&hellip;.] was doing much better than i was.  here he was making pretty good money in the army, getting a new bride, a new place.  how dare he marry out of order!  ok, so those weren't the prominent thoughts.  the underlying feelings were happiness, but those other things were always in the back of my mind.
when you hear the <em>ding</em>, turn the page.
well, the morning of the wedding [actually at the wedding] i meet one of amy's friends.  abby.  she just walks up and introduces herself, saying 'i've heard so much about you&hellip;.no, no, all good things,' etc.  i'm so shocked at this girl that i probably could have blushed.  maybe i did. i dunno.
&quot;but it's just a pretty face, bryan. keep telling yourself that. you don't need any distractions.&quot;
but she's not just a pretty face.
so what other excuse can i make up.
&quot;she's just coming out of a long relationship.  in fact, it's still not officially over&hellip;don't get yourself into that mess&quot;
but pretty soon that's all over&hellip;and she starts going out of her way to see me&hellip;
slyly.
we have very similar personalities&hellip;she's going to school to be a special ed teacher&hellip;which i find very admirable&hellip;she actually READS for pleasure&hellip;she's motivated and has the potential to whip me into shape [probably is already doing so]&hellip;goal oriented&hellip;and so damn sexy, it drives me wild.
so we've been seeing each other the last few weeks, whenever our busy schedules allow us.  we both work and go to school, and have pretty busy social lives&hellip;so sometimes it's tough, but i really like this girl.  a lot.  i haven't had butterflies for anyone in about 3 years&hellip;
i just don't know what to think because if i end up gong to U of M or MSU&hellip;i'm going to be kind of far away.  i guess i'll just take it as it comes.  but i'm done making life decisions based on anyone's life but my own; what's necessary for ME.  all too often in the past i've compromised my plans for someone else.
over 'spring break' my parents helped amy and brad move to north carolina&hellip;into their new place&hellip;.so i watched over their place&hellip;made sure eric got to school, fed the dogs&hellip;but that week was just chaos.  i started a new job so i couldn't always be here to make sure things were ok.
the morning of my first day of work, i got up at 5am, showered, did my thing&hellip;went down stairs to make a copy of my driver's license and social security card&hellip;and in doing so stepped into a flooded basement.  computers and other electronics were on the ground, trevor's drum kit, my amp, my guitar&hellip;all kinds of stuff.  all i had time to move before i had to leave was the drum kit, guitar and amp.  a computer, cd burner and misc. other things are officially fried.  so i couldn't make a copy of my stuff&hellip;.went to work empty handed&hellip;almost late&hellip;.not a good impression.
my second day of work, i leave extra early to make up for things&hellip;to go to the copy place and leave plenty of time for myself.  i decide to take my mom's car just for kicks&hellip;
so i stop by the ATM machine to get some cash out [ i needed gas&hellip;and smokes] but i realize i don't have my card&hellip;so i spend my only $5 dollars on a pack of smokes&hellip;and ride on fumes to the copy place.  i get there and theres a sign that says OUT OF BUSINESS. WHAT!~!?! so i hop in the car and drive around looking for a place to get a copy made&hellip;and of course there is no where.  i watch my minutes tick away, and i'm starting to get worried i'm going to be late.
LIGHTBULB
i stop in at holiday inn&hellip;cause i figure they cater to business people sometimes&hellip;and sure enough, i'm in and out with a FREE copy in hand.  i get in the car and it won't start~!!!!!  i get on the phone to try and call my brother, so he can give me the number for work&hellip;so i can call them&hellip;but of course my brother is still sleeping at 2pm&hellip;.so i let it ring until it won't ring anymore&hellip;.and then i call again. and again. 411 didn't know the number. i call home again.  i lift the hood and start beating the starter with my fist.  i'm so furious that i don't even notice that i've laid my arm on a VERY HOT part of the car.  my skin melted right off.  so i just slam the hood and sit there in the car with my head on the steering wheel.  i try one more time&hellip;.and the stupid ass car STARTS right then and there&hellip;first try&hellip;.so next thing you know, i'm going 80 in a 55&hellip;all the while i see 6 cops with people pulled off to the side of the road&hellip;.thank god they were busy.  i made it to work 2 minutes late and no one even notices.
since that day, things have been going wonderfully, but i about had a breakdown. :)
ok, i think i'm done.</p>

			 <p>i've been touched by their despair.  signatures in thought, words, brushstrokes on canvas, or melodies on eardrums.  sometimes rejoicing to, other times empathizing with.  wrapping my mind around to grasp, sink in or float on whilst rarely breathing, feeling it. rush around the body.
kiss its cheek.
blow through like shivers.
the mind, it tries.  vigorously it tries to figure out what it already knows&ndash;though through accepting the keystone as heart, it dethrones itself.
contradiction.<br>
in its self-righteousness and separation as the driver to the body, the rider, the viewer; in its own complication and majesty, must assume that it is greater than any organ, greater than merely flesh: a divine entity in itself.  even whilst writing these words the surface of my subconscious snickers that the hand lay out such sentiments.  tis true, that most forget to forget, and i, myself, will spend much time trying to remember to forget.  trying to quiet this inner monologue.</p>

			 <p>haha.  one of the best profile's i've read in a long time :</p>
<p>Here are some updated pointers for a better life:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tight pants and white belts don't make you smart.</li>
<li>Sick tat, bro.</li>
<li>There is a fair chance that Ulysses (dog on left) has been to more shows and is a bigger scenester than you.</li>
<li>If you didn't go to &quot;Argle-bargle summer camp 1974&quot;&hellip;why are you wearing the t-shirt?
and finally..</li>
<li>I read Nietzche and Marx too. <em>yawn</em> Stop trying to be deep, dark, and mysterious, because sensitive artists are a dime a dozen.</li>

			 <p>So I guess I better do an update on this past weekend because it was truly stupendous.  Trev and I started off by heading down to grand rapids friday night.  We met up with elizabeth at her place [cool loft, can't believe she's moving out].  Did some bar hopping but didn't find one we'd have liked to stay at so we drove over to good ol' Billy's Lounge, a jazz/blues club we frequent.  Did some drinking.  Did some dancing.  Had a good time.</p>
<p>Saturday we chilled out at her place while she worked and watched some movies [ie, army of darkness&hellip;] and at about 4 we went and got in line at the church to see Micheal Moore speak.  Of course it was freezing outside and we had to get there about an hour and a half early.  Thank gawd for that though because there were about 3000 people who didn't get in.  Including elizabeth because she got out of work late.  But the speech was totally, completely exhilerating.  I've never felt so in-touch with so many people before&hellip;.ever.  And to top it all off, it was sorta ironic that it was in a church.  He was at the podium where a priest/pastor/whatever would stand.  Everytime he cursed, he'd look up at the painting of jesus and wince&hellip;or make lightning bolt animations/sounds.  The church was beautiful.  Most of the people were pretty cool, too, because a lot of them were Kendall art students.  Though there were people of all demographics there, surprisingly enough.  Grand Rapids is an awesome town.  Despite it's relatively high republican population, it has a pretty big counter culture.  Later that night we went and bought the Dane Cook CD/DVD and laughed half the night away.  And then I fucked the rest of the night.  Gawgeous.</p>

			 <p>i got my guitar out today.  dusted it off.
i think that's part of what's missing.
trevor is going to move his old kit into my basement and we're going to play.
if i get this job i've applied for&hellip;i'll have money finally.
i've decided i need to move.
maybe portland. or vancouver.  somewhere with mountains.
when i look around i think about that song by trail of dead:
&quot;the ruined landscape i once called home&quot;
i swear they must be from the midwest.  especially judging by that picture in the liner notes.  i think they're really from texas.  but that photo is definitely michigan or wisconsin.  anyway, i don't know what i'm talking about.  blow me a fucking kiss.</p>

			 <p>Though I've always enjoyed the style of Whitman and Ginsberg, I've never really toyed with it on my own until last night.  May-be crap, but it is still my own:</p>
<p>You for who I have searched and gone to such lengths to make my presence known,
You for whom I have pondered, albeit without any cost to you; though in contrast,
I've dream'd more so than lived: fairly I proclaim my own self-loathing for this, before any other should tell me to feel likewise,
For with whom I would need to agree, as if neon lit or milked sickness, true;
Though the pleasure would not be theirs while worn on my sleeve
I have experienced such pleasures as friends quite dear; through symposium and in private, I have enjoyed their simplified answers to my woes (they have humored me so!),
But there is an ache in me that will not be massaged by the occasional high spirit (though temporarily by the intoxicating variety),
A child I am in my selfishness, though I know the prayer of the Buddha,
But if there ever was anything so intoxicating as to have me throw away a True path, this Love would undoubtedly be it, leaving me forever unchanged and unfolded.</p>

			 <p>driving home.
from wherever, so long as home is my destination.
i catch myself looking around my surroundings and criticizing everything; bitching about every little thing, at first.  &quot;why can't&hellip;.how come&hellip;.where's the&hellip;.&quot;
but then a peace usually washes over me.  i see a bridge and a sign that reads &quot;pine river&quot; and i think how i would have killed to see that bridge so many times before when it was an impossibility.  projecting myself into the future i see myself in a far off place, tied down in roots of stability, no more big questions about the future, no more big dreams, wishing that i was back on those country roads in my car and in my head with the most infinite of possibilities and color schemes.  i think of the old saying 'those who have lost everything are free to do anything' and mold it to my own liking.  'those who have never had anything are free to dream about everything.'  maybe it's the snow falling and the endless white and the slick roads in their entrancing straightness and the hum of the tires that hypnotize and chill my spine.  i try to hold onto that shiver, make it last as long as i can.  it helps me feel like i'm in touch with something much larger than i.  for when it's gone, the clarity goes with it and the empty passenger seat becomes too much to handle.  if i hold the chill, i feel the moment that is.  i don't feel old tears or embraces.  i don't think of impossibilities or the unfathomables.  i don't get caught up in thought and miss the moment that is.  but when it's gone my head starts-a-dreamin' of days that will never come, and days that have and never will again.</p>

			 <p>so i had an interesting week/weekend.</p>
<p>the week started out kind of weird with maria and i hanging out a couple of days.  very sweet girl and cute as hell but i'm not so sure she's the opposing puzzle piece.  but i guess we'll have some fun.</p>
<p>stopped by jen's place because she said she had a christmas present waiting for me&hellip;and it was a wonderful scarf!  i love hand-made gifts.</p>
<p>thursday morning i received an email update for a show going on at the diaper so i started to make plans to get a semi-large group to go.  thought i'd steal the suburban [gross, right..] for the night and pile 'em in.  well as it turns out, jonathan is busy with his up coming play [as always] so him and ashley are out, trevor is out cold with some sort of sickness, can't get a hold of jess , so by this point i'm thinking all's lost.  but indeed i was wrong!  bergey was the only one who pulled through.  so we said fuck it and went anyway&hellip;and rocked the joint like the true gangstas that we are.  heard some great bands such as HUGS, The Setup and The Sea The Sea.  I was so impressed with The Sea The Sea that I saw them again at Mac's Bar friday night.  Kind of slow there, but still a great show.  Met some random people that night that invited me to their place&hellip;drank, played some jams&hellip;and ended up crashing on their couch.  [to they i am truly thankful, for i was smashed. glad i didn't get raped.]  drove to a holiday inn the next morning and got a room, watched some movies and made good use of the hot tub and sauna.  relaxed most of sunday-day and finally ended the weekend with watching Big Fish with trev and liz.  Wasn't a horrible movie but i have to say that i was kind of disappointed because i had high expectations.  but i had a good night, no less.</p>
<p>hrm. so that's an update.</p>

Live At Ibiza: how'd that absinthe taste?
spira infinitas: i guess not.  maria had to leave because she has to get up at 6 and when they left, amy said she didn't even know when she had to go in tomorrow. i guess today she was over an hour late. she thought she had to be there at 5 but she was supposed to be there at noon. they called her and she went in.
spira infinitas: the absinthe tastes like really fucking strong jagermeister.
Live At Ibiza: hahaha

spira infinitas: yea. sorry dude-i won't drink anymore.
Live At Ibiza: we'll drink it when i get home and just get all kinds of shitty off of it.

			 <p>this has been the laziest weekend of my life.  i've basically just sat around rolling cigarettes, drinking wine and having conversation with my mother.  my brother eric just got his first tattoos yesterday and though they are somewhat generic, i almost feel that everyone has to have at least one.  i'm proud of my lil bro :*)  also saw some photos of brad's tattoos at the shop.  it was kind of weird.  he called yesterday and informed us that this week he's moving to camp babylon and then to kuwait and will be headed for home by either the end of this month or early february.  i haven't heard that happiness in his voice in so long&hellip;.i can't wait to see him.</p>
<p>also, the last couple of days have been very spring-like and it's had me feeling like it was actually coming; but that's just a dirty trick because we all know that michigan summer doesn't come until may.  i think we're about to get slammed by snow storms.  i hate snow. i can deal with the cold.  i just don't want any damn snow.  yes, las vegas, take all of it!</p>
<p>school starts the 13th for me and i'm kinda excited about my classes, though i have 1 more class than i did last semester so i hope i can do as well.  i took an art class in place of a true speech class&ndash;i wonder how i'll do!  i'm also taking cultural anthropology, a soc class, and astronomy [which i'm geeked about.]</p>

			 <p>god and i had the best make-up sex ever, today.  oral report for government went extremely well and i got many good responses from it, especially concerning my comparison of the patriot act to george orwell's 1984.  i also received a 96/100 on the exam.  bought a cd for the first time in months, though i had to pay with credit, music is one of the only things that really puts that excitement in me with the giddiness of a child. got interviewed by a camera crew on the sidewalk in front of urban outfitters in east lansing.  i thought i'd play the part of the optimist when they asked if i believed in god and if so, have i ever witnessed something where i thought god was at work.  they may have been theology majors at msu or something but i couldn't pass up the opportunity.  i said something to the tune of, &quot;well, though i don't subscribe to any particular religion, i do in fact consider myself to be in touch with what some would call god; with my spirituality, and despite some major disappointments i see in the world, i can't help but look around sometimes and simply relish in the miracle that is life, our place in the cosmos, and the overall beauty in all things&hellip;&quot;  The guys just stood there kind of slack-jawed and said, &quot;uh, um, uh thank you&hellip;&quot; as i walked away.  also, i saw paul at urban outfitters&hellip;talking to the gal that i'm kicking myself over for not asking out [still working on that confidence thing]&hellip;but we might hang out this weekend.  maybe i can get to her through him?  haha.  i'm evil. evil.  the entire time, pick up a book, pretend that i'm reading something really interesting, put it down, pick up another, glance over at her behind the counter and feel my heart go thump-thump, then shy away again, looking at clothes i know i won't buy, but every second i spend in there is a chance that maybe she'll trip over me, where then i'll have to pick her up, say extraordinarily meaningful things, promise her the world and then live happily ever after.  uh huh.</p>

&quot;Now you're bragging, darling.  You know you don't need to brag.  Just start your prayers or poetry or something when they tell you to breathe deeply.  You'll be lovely that way and I'll be so proud of you.  I'm very proud of you anyway.  You have such a lovely temperature and you sleep like a little boy with your arm around the pillow and think it's me.  Or is it some other girl?  Some fine Italian girl?&quot;
&quot;It's you.&quot;
&quot;Of course it's me.  Oh I do love you and Valentini will make you a fine leg.  I'm glad I don't have to watch it.&quot;
&quot;And you'll be on night duty to-night.&quot;
&quot;Yes.  But you won't care.&quot;
&quot;You wait and see.&quot;
&quot;There, darling.  Now you're all clean inside and out.  Tell me.  How many people have you ever loved?&quot;
&quot;Nobody.&quot;
&quot;Not me even?&quot;
&quot;Yes, you.&quot;
&quot;How many others really?&quot;
&quot;None.&quot;
&quot;How many have-how do you say it?-stayed with?&quot;
&quot;None.&quot;
&quot;You're lying to me.&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;It's alright.  Keep right on lying to me.  That's what I want you to do.  Were they pretty?&quot;
&quot;I never stayed with anyone.&quot;
&quot;That's right.  Were they very attractive?&quot;
&quot;I don't know anything about it.&quot;
&quot;You're just mine.  That's true and you've never belonged to anyone else.  But I don't care if you have.  I'm not afraid of them.  But don't tell me about them.  When a man stays with a girl when does she say how much it costs?&quot;
&quot;I don't know.&quot;
&quot;Of course not.  Does she say she loves him?  Tell me that.  I want to know that.&quot;
&quot;Yes.  If he wants her to.&quot;
&quot;Does he say he loves her?  Tell me please.  It's important.&quot;
&quot;He does if he wants to.&quot;
&quot;But you never did?  Really?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;Not really.  Tell me the truth.&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; I lied.
&quot;You wouldn't,&quot; she said.  &quot;I knew you wouldn't.  Oh, I love you, darling.&quot;
Outside the sun was up over the roofs and I could see the points of the cathedral with the sunlight on them.  I was clean inside and out and waiting for the doctor.
&quot;And that's it?&quot;  Catherine said.  &quot;She says just what he wants her to?&quot;
&quot;Not always.&quot;
&quot;But I will.  I'll say just what you wish and I'll do what you wish and then you will never want any other girls, will you?&quot;  She looked at me very happily.  &quot;I'll do what you want and say what you want and then I'll be a great success, won't I?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;What would you like me to do now that you're all ready?&quot;
&quot;Come to bed again.&quot;
&quot;All right.  I'll come.&quot;
&quot;Oh darling, darling, darling,&quot; I said.
&quot;You see,&quot; she said.  &quot;I do anything you want.&quot;
&quot;You're so lovely.&quot;
&quot;I want what you want.  There isn't any me any more.  Just what you want.&quot;
&quot;You sweet.&quot;
&quot;I'm good aren't I?  You don't want any other girls, do you?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;You see?  I'm good.  I do what you want.&quot;</p>

			 <p>I have people I know.  Some are good to me.  Some are good for me.  Others are kind of like back drops, indifferent.  Sometimes I feel alone.  Sometimes I'm happy in my solitude.  I know I'm not all that different than a lot of folks out there, but where are they?  Sometimes I feel elite.  Sometimes I feel like gum stuck to the shoe of society.  Sometimes I feel like my 'friends' page is a beautiful log from a separate world to which I don't belong.  A place I can only read about and not take part in.</p>

			 <p>went to grand rapids last night.  almost forgot how much i love that town.  ended up at liz's loft, someone I haven't seen in about 2 years.  really made my night because she's so carefree and cute, it just puts me in a good mood.  we ended up going to a little jazz club down where the Intersection used to be [but is no longer] and it was totally bangin'.  got a late start on the night, but aside from that I had a really good time.  hopefully i'll be making more appearances in GR.</p>
<p>still don't know if florida is 100 percent right now, but I guess I'll find out on tuesday.  i'd like to go.  it'd give me a little break from this place.  all depends on a damn pol test&hellip;because my prof. has trouble following a schedule and I have no idea when it's going to be.</p>
<p>Also, I got my first b+ this semester&hellip;kind of bummed me out but it was bound to happen. BARGH!</p>
<p>My mom just left with my brother's fiance and mother-in-law to go to the casino.  I guess the chip 'n dales are there.  <em>shudder</em></p>

<p>damn it be cold.</p>
<p>Also, I love it when pretty people get bent out of shape when you tell them that they're getting special treatment because they are pretty.</p>
<p>&quot;oh whatever! they can't just like my PERSONALITY?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, but chances are, if you have a cute face and a set of boobs, people are going to do things for you that they otherwise wouldn't.  Some of the coolest girls I know are fat chicks.  Whatever nature didn't endow them with as far as physical beauty goes, they sure made up for in the personality dept.</p>
<p>But who do you think got the job?  The girl with more qualifications or the cute girl with the little skirt who always seems to drop her pencil?</p>
<p>Who got backstage?</p>
<p>Who got sold alcohol when they forgot their ID?</p>
<p>My point is, I know this girl who has a car that always breaks down.  One time she broke down on the side of the highway and she forgot her phone at home so she couldn't call for help.  She figured somebody would stop and maybe give her a lift to a payphone but after half an hour of waving people down, still not a soul stopped.  She had to walk 6 miles to the closest exit.  The next time the car broke down, she had a friend with her.  5'9&quot;, 125lbs, gorgeous girl.  4 people stopped and asked if they needed help in the span of 15 minutes.  This shit makes me sick to my stomach.</p>

			 <p>the chill goes all the way to the bone tonight.  hemingway in a dull corner of my room with my thoughts in northern italy and my music from iceland.  i don't know what has been going on lately with me because for the most part i have been satisfied, or maybe just numb and ill-perceptive of my real feelings.  i don't know where i want to be but i'm pretty sure i don't want to be here anymore.  no, i don't want to be here anymore.  i've picked up and left far too many times though and the next time i go somewhere, i'd like to settle in and be there for a while.  this place has no spirit, no dreams.  i've been asking complete strangers questions.  &quot;haven't you ever wanted to see the world?&quot; or &quot;wouldn't you like to live somewhere else?&quot;.  the most common answers are usually, &quot;why would i want to leave my home&quot;, or &quot;i guess i've never thought about it.&quot;.  maybe that's just the problem.  i don't feel like i belong here anymore.  i used to. kind of at least.  the only thing attaching me to this place is money and family.  i could leave and never come back if it weren't for them.  if a meteor killed them all, i'd leave and stay where ever it is i go.</p>
<p>i'd also like a friend that appreciates me.  doesn't take advantage of me.  stands by my side.  and of course theres love.  i see a lot of people just mingling, swapping, sleeping around.  i just can't do that.  maybe i'll regret it when i'm old, but if i can't respect a person's mind, i cannot sleep with them. i physically cannot do it without being sickened with myself, sick to my stomach.  and quite honestly, i haven't found anyone that i respect.  i mean, i treat everyone pleasantly, but that doesn't mean i have to necessarily like them.  it's kind of like eating what you're given to eat when you're starving to death.  even if it does happen to be seafood or mushrooms.</p>
<p>i feel like i can't focus on today because my mind is always retrospective of good times or i'm looking prospective to things that i'd like to see happen.  i often look back and i cannot for the life of me remember entire blocks of my life.  because i wasn't living it. i was reliving or dreaming.  i just don't think that can be healthy.  but in my defense, its hard to make the best of things when theres no opportunity.  and of course everyone offers up there advice.  &quot;why don't you get a job doing&hellip;&quot; or &quot;i know what would be perrrrfect for you&hellip;&quot;.  they have no idea.  i don't want to get stuck like they have.  sure, everybody needs a little money to do things, to pay bills, etc, but quite frankly its not all that important to me.  i'd rather be somewhere i love, at rock bottom, working my way up slowly and enjoying myself.  stability really does seem appealing these days though. oh, sure, i'd love a brand new car and house and maybe a gal at my side,  but is it worth the deficit?  the obligation? the end? i don't think so.  i'll just wait and do my time and watch the people i know get stuck, and i'll stay slow and steady, without the need for a more comfortable life right now.  and when they're divorced and giving half their money to child support and half of their belongings to the significant other, i'll be laughing internally. i'm a cynical little bastard.  and theres only one of them that i'd let sleep on my couch.  but i don't think i'd let him get himself into that sort of mess in the first place.<br>
funny who sticks with you when you're really in need.</p>

			 <p>this house, it was haunted
the moment he took aim
with no apparent motive
crimson now flesh's fate</p>
<p>pistol plane stayed tangent
and in-line with the face
of a once quiet child
who'd always take the blame</p>
<p>'cause even a swift hand
was attention still desired
and through tired tenaments
those wishes, they transpired</p>
<p>the quiet buzz of appliances
ping pong down hallway walls
soft water from the faucet
echoing it's whispered call:</p>
<p>&quot;come way with me
come way with me
down the drain and hide
never they'll find you here nor there
with the ocean we'll collide!
come way with me
come way with me
down the drain we'll roll
free from this, forever we'll be
release that tattered soul!&quot;</p>
<p>and with this something came
as if to reawaken the past
all those nightmare sessions
they swore would never last</p>
<p>in the recesses of the psyche
there they had found their niche
unconsciously tormenting
all those years now missed</p>
<p>and so there lay before me
a withered, aiming man
right above my brow is where
he had that bullet planned</p>
<p>but in this dream, i swear to you
i murdered him that day
this house, it was haunted
the moment he took aim</p>

			 <p>if companies/corps were fair, there would be no need for unions. if they weren't profiteering gluttons, they wouldn't move their factories to foreign countries with lower/no wage laws and little-to-no enforcements on environmental issues.  welcome to the horrible world of capitalism, folks.  I say instead of pointing that rifle mouth of yours at forums, and instead of crossing picket lines, try standing up for civil rights and facing the people who are really at cause here&ndash;the totalitarian, Orwellian, capitalistic scum we call congress.  yeah, that's right. you voted in the guy who has only made 5 votes this entire year&hellip;because he was too busy focusing on his golf game and his retirement to give two shits about anything but himself and perpetuating his progeny.  he put on a smiling face for the camera, kissed a few babies in your neighborhood, so people don't even think twice&hellip;never check the records of the library of congress&hellip;probably because they're too busy running back and forth from their job they hate, trying to buy things they don't need, watching entirely too much television and basically wasting their lives focusing on material possessions.</p>
<p>do you have any idea why we spend so much money on defense?  to protect your fat, ignorant ass? sure. to an extent. so you can earn/spend that green.  but have you ever really broken it down?  why do we outspend the top 10+ countries in defense?  because no one gives two shits about who got the bid to build the tanks and bombers.  no one questions how much these things cost.  and should they?  who cares about these things when they're running their kids back and forth to school.  but as soon as they start investing that money into social programs&hellip;hospitals, schools, etc., people immediately want a say in how the money is spent.  G-8. BINGO! I have a Bingo!</p>
<p>Sure, this may be over-simplifying the problem.  But you know what's going on behind the scenes, even without knowing the details.  It sure feeds my inner Socialist.  Maybe I'm putting too much faith in the heart of common man, the common good and the humility/self sacrifice of humanity in general.  So long as it is allowed for any group of people to become the Elite, there will always be a caste, a poverty, a lower, middle and upper class.  Is it your God-given right to be holier than thou, richer than thou, only to be concerned with your own interest?  what about love thy neighbor? what the hell ever happened to that?  the golden rule?  equality.  revolution my friend. it will happen.  and you're goddamn right I'll be a part of it.</p>
<p>maybe this is a little explosive for the topic at hand, but this is what it boils down to.  so quit your yapping about petty issues such as unions and how they should be thankful to have a job in 'this shitty Michigan economy'. we all know the real offenders here.  mega corps, capitalism, extremist fundamentalist groups, lobbyists, international relations, our reliance on oil, and this government I refer to as Oceania.</p>
<p>And don't even try and feed me the crap about how I should be sooo thankful to be in this country and how there are plenty of places where I'd be worse off.  Ever stop to think that we're the cause for the current state of our earth's third-world nations? sure, not entirely, or all-inclusively.  Nicaragua anyone?  Haiti?  Brazil?  Or any other country in this hemisphere that isn't somehow associated with Britain.  The people in Haiti are starving because all the good land in the country is owned by corps and is used so you can have a banana in your cereal.  There are people in Brazil that are so malnourished due to some of our embargoes that scientists are classifying them as a different species because their brain mass has decreased in size to about 60% of a healthy homo-Sapiens'.  Oh, but these are just some examples and I'm sure I could throw a few more names around [Cambodia], but I don't think [panama] that would make [puppet Israel] you think [Afghanistan] any differently.</p>
<p>good day.</p>

			 <p>what a long damn day.
i didn't go to bed last night so i could actually get some sleep this evening.
actually got some stuff accomplished though! amazing what you can do with an extra 8-9 hours.</p>
<p>so yes, the halloween weekend was pretty crazy.  didn't turn out exactly as i had hoped but i guess i have no complaints.  friday was nuts; trevor and i went to a sorority party&hellip;hahaha.  i learned how to do the ghetto booty shake. well, not really. but i got to witness a few girls try and teach eachother.  it's funny. small town frats and sororities are just a bunch of stoner/theatre majors.  sho isn't like msu. sorostitutes.  we managed to play a few sets in the basement, and quite well i might add.</p>
<p>of course the fro was a success. and the boa. .</p>
<p>friday night was supposed to be the big shindig at the lake but i got uninvited due to a couple specific people on the guest list. i.e&hellip;justin, kerri, angela.  not that i have a problem with anyone but i'm sure i'm pretty high up on justin's 'people to kill' list.  we still showed up to pay our respects to the people that love us. 20 minutes in and out, no fists thrown.  a couple tears on trevor's part, but that was probably because he had more alcohol in his system than blood.</p>
<p>so we went instead to a bar on the lake where we proceded to drink heavily and eat&hellip;both for free mind you.  it's good to know people.</p>
<p>back over to jonathon's for a party&hellip;played some music in the basement&hellip;while people laughed at us.  too much booze.</p>
<p>ahh. and sleeping in until 1 on sunday.</p>
<p>sure makes ya feel like a winner&hellip;</p>

			 <p>ice-blue mercury glow on my breath's fog
and sparkling in an arched urine stream.
i've never been mesmerized by a urine stream.
not until tonight that is.
LOOK UP
no stars.
hrmph.
LOOK DOWN
dew.
oak leaves.
leaves that i know should be burning red
but the mercury light has turned them a deep lavender
CRUNCH CRUNCH
how pleasing is this?
CRUNCH CRUNCH
chilling little night this is.
oh god, what is this night.
what are my coordinates
why is my spine&hellip;
CRUNCH CRUNCH
ZIP
BREATH
one year since my last breath of such cold air
i thought i'd be so frightened&hellip;
but it's never been so comforting
and the nostalgia is so warming, unlike usual
and even the emptiness is so familiar
like i've gone beyond some point
some invisible line drawn in the sands of my life
and beyond the grave whispers &quot;it's too late&hellip;&quot;
BREATH
this has become all too familiar territory
emptiness is now my comrade, my patron
but it's just that certain place&hellip;you know.
not everywhere, just&hellip;..that place.
SIGH
no stars
BREATH
The buffer for sending&hellip;..love&hellip;.it's streaming
The receiving&hellip;that's a long since forgotten road
if i had a cigarette i'd light it
and fill something inside me.
i'll just go through the motions like some movie star.
like james dean.
fingers to my lips in an exaggerated manner
inhale air and exhale that same familiar fog
flip my collar up and tilt my head at the cloud cover
waiting for an object. something.
maybe a comet to fall to my feet.
i'd pick it up and bounce it from hand to hand like a hot potato
and blow on it.
stick it in my pocket.
maybe give it to that person.

			 <p>So my parents just got back from visiting my uncle [the one I was living with] in Florida and they absolutely adore his new house.  My mom is so geeked and she's talking about moving down there.  Theres this 6 bedroom house, 3 car garage they want to build and it would be really quite inexpensive compared to places up here.  My mom has the type of job where she can work at home anywhere she goes but my step dad needs a power plant to work at&hellip;so she's been looking for jobs for him like all day.  It's kind of fun to see my mom in this state.  I hate to see her stagnating and it's cool to see her all giddy.  I guess we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>I wish I had a good idea for a halloween costume.  Any suggestions?  I don't even really know what I'm going to do&ndash;there are about 12 events I'd like to attend and they're all spread out so it wouldn't be easy [probably impossible with drinks] to jump from place to place.</p>
<p>Also, I didn't care for this album much when I first heard it, but the more I listen, the more I like.  Guess I've been listening to too much retro shit lately to appreciate it at first.  Some of the guitar and drum work is amazing. m/</p>

			 <p>no charitable hello or glance in my direction
just a graceful walk-by to test my lacking patience
warming sensations, thoughts of sexual situations
dark brown on gold and hand-me-down kisses
denim wrapped candy skin to envelop my senses
congratulations, this autumn has brought with it temptation
inspiring scribbled sonnets on white diner napkins
beige coffee ring stains over my love confessions
heart-choked logic in thump-thump succession
that's all i need is another superficial distraction
to cloud progress by reality's definition
&quot;what a waste&quot; whispered at my funeral procession
but even a bland rhyming scheme can ease my tensions
when my heart seems bigger than my chest's dimensions</p>

			 <p>last night was amazing.</p>
<p>the open mic night was such a success, in my opinion.  i ended up dropping some acid [haven't done anything like that in years] but i don't regret anything.  i had a most wonderful time, something that hasn't happened in an eternity.  i got to play the drums for a long time last night and this morning too.  i think jonathon and i are going to start playing again, just for kicks.  i might move into the house and sleep on couches&hellip;who knows&hellip;haha, it should be a good time.  we'll see.</p>
<p>i was very surprised at some of the poems i heard, too.  maybe it was just the lsd talking but it was very emotional.  anyway, i got my drug use out of the way for the year.  back to writing papers, panels, and studying for an exam.</p>

			 <p>So last night kicked some ass.</p>
<p>Didn't do a whole lot but I did go see Texas Chainsaw Massacre!
Before we went, I suggested that we get a pint of Southern Comfort.  So we did and smuggled it in and spiked our cokes and got buzzed at a scarey movie.  I really liked the movie and I don't normally like those types of things.  Maybe it had something to do with the gorgeous babe that was the main character.  Goddamnit, sex really does sell.  They should make a scarey movie where some psycho murders marketing majors.</p>
<p>Tonight is supposed to be an open mic over at theta chi's basement.  I'll probably end up going over there but I don't know if I'll read any of my stuff.  I'm actually just hoping that this Hilary girl is going to be there.</p>
<p>Still not smoking.  It's hard though when everyone you know smokes.  Still pulling all A's in school, but I have a lot of shit due next week thus a lot of bullshit to do this weekend.  FOCUS.</p>

			 <p>went to a pretty damn good show last night with adam, adrian and a couple of randoms.</p>
<p>Tuba and Drums, a local band, really rocked the house.  They were a 3 piece&hellip;1 guitarist, a drummer, and that's right,  A TUBA player who also played synths, scratches, and trumpet!  Brilliant.</p>
<p>The other band was called The Roots of Orchis.  They were from SanFran and I ended up buying their CD.  They were damn good.</p>
<p>I can't believe I'm actually still doing really well in school.  I'm sick of this semester already though.  I'm sick of everything right now actually.  I'm so BORED with life.  Someone should come visit me.  I have the entire house to myself this weekend and no one to share it with.</p>
<p>I've actually been thinking alot about Florida recently and wishing that I had gotten to know more people.  I think I would have liked to stay longer if I would have had  1 or 2 people on my side.  And that Ally girl&hellip;grrrr. HAHA.</p>

			 <p>Been pretty busy, and when I'm not being busy, I'm being lazy.</p>
<p>Brad has been home on leave from Iraq because of our father's death.  It's been weird having the entire family under one roof.  This hasn't happened in about 2 years.  It's like a time warp.  He also proposed to his girlfriend, gave her a big ol' ring and they're supposed to get married when he gets out of the army.  weird.  My little brother getting married.  I guess he still has a while before he gets out but it's still unbelievable.</p>
<p>School is going okay, a little too much sometimes, but all good things are worth working/fighting for.  I have yet to find a job so I'm really really really broke and my patience has been tried many a time.</p>
<p>Trevor is like my only friend anymore and we're been going out drinking like one night a week and that seems to be my only escape.  And a pretty shitty escape, usually, since there is nothing but club bars here and absolutely no culture what-so-ever.  I don't know how I was forged from this place, honestly.</p>
<p>Trying to maintain a PMA.  Still accepting applications for love.  Pretty frustrating when everyone is so shallow.</p>

			 <p>WOW~!  Just woke up a little bit ago.  Fell alseep around 11am because I really didn't get any sleep last night.  I walked around the U of M campus in beautiful Ann Arbor with Ashley last night.  She showed me the law library and holy smokes!  That place is so beautiful!  Like a lot of things there, I guess.  If I ever make it to grad school, if I don't end up going someplace warm, I'm going there.</p>
<p>Ash is a very sweet, very intelligent girl.  Pleasantly surprised.  Looking forward to our next get together.</p>
<p>The weather is shit right now and everyone is gone, so I'm here alone and it's kind of depressing, but I'll try not to let it suck me in too far.</p>
<p>We picked up my brother from the airport yesterday.  He flew in from Iraq on emergency leave because of the situation with my father.  It's sooo good to see him!!!!!!  I haven't seen him in almost a year :(</p>

			 <p>I can't help but feel a bit cheated.  Pissed off.  Half of me is you, though I don't know which half.  Maybe the stubbornness and laziness or maybe the half that's always in the clouds dreaming of my next big break.</p>
<p>I never got the chance to find out.</p>
<p>With your eviscerated body came the same fate of my soul.  Did you not see my eyes as a child and how they questioned &quot;Why, why, why?!&quot;  These blue eyes that you gave to me.  What went through your mind when you drove off with me chasing after, legs pumping with the hysteria of being left behind.  Did you laugh at the sight of your son in the rear-view or did it make you so sick that you dared not look?  I almost caught you that day, I'll have you know, and let's be glad for your sake that I didn't, for you would have felt the fury of those tiny fists and all that had been bottled would have poured from my body.  I would have murdered you myself that day.</p>
<p>Many years have passed and I've redefined my definition of what it means to be a &quot;man&quot;, though I'm still struggling to find myself.  The truth is now, that I would not be the person I am today if you HAD been in my life.  I am proud of who I have become, though my feats are few and many questions and uncertainties still remain.  The labyrinth of life, I'm finding, has no right or wrong answer and all too often we concentrate on the crux, the struggle instead of focusing on love for life itself.</p>
<p>I never thought I'd grow up before you, but even as it were, I always thought you'd grow in some way, at some distant day and that most forgiveness would be granted, some integrity restored, and I would have at least be given an apology.  A chance to speak my mind was never given.  A chance for me to hand off this weight permanently to the person it's attributed to.</p>
<p>I wonder if your life flashed before your eyes through blood and rain and broken glass and if so, was your last revisited memory a black and white still-framed shot of me through your rear-view mirror, fists on pavement and tears on cheeks?  If so, I am so infinitely sorry for you.  Sorry for all of your loose ends left undone.  Now all I can imagine is what may have been implied.  I'll grant you the benefit of the doubt, though not easily.  In fact, it's painstakingly difficult, but I will not have you carry this burden into the next life.  We are all but human.</p>

			 <p>Who is going to Cursive, Blood Brothers and Eastern Youth tonight?  Ashley, I think you should find a way to get there.  If you can't, give me a call by about 5:30 @ 904.476.5793.  Ann Arbor isn't out of the way&hellip;by too much.</p>

			 <p>I was just pondering something. I would never become vegan but IF [and this is a HYPOTHETICAL] I were to become one, would I have to get rid of my sea shell ash tray? I found it on the beach and I did no harm to the mollusk. Guess it doesn't matter. I realize the health benefits of protien and iron‚Ä¶and after all‚Ä¶I do have a few k‚Äì9 teeth and I think that implies something.</p>

			 <p>I just feel very blah lately.  Nothing too exciting is happening&hellip;.went out a few times this week and i had a good time, but then it's right back to life.  Same boring life.  Ever dream of that life where you fly by the seat of your pants and that around every corner is something new?  Something exciting or peaceful or wonderful or horrible&hellip;just something that has a little more variability than the flat-lining of what i've had lately.  i think my main problem is that i don't have someone to empty all of this bottled up love onto.  and get loved in return.  it's been a really long time since i've had that flame that defies all logic&hellip;but is wonderful and scary all at the same time.  Theres a girl out there that I'm pretty sure could fill that void, but unfortunately she's in Atlanta.  Goddamnit Georgia.</p>

			 <p>My brother Brad just called from Iraq. I tell you, I&rsquo;m really starting to miss that kid. He can&rsquo;t stand it over there, and though he&rsquo;s not a man of many words, he knows that it&rsquo;s ridiculous that he&rsquo;s over there in the first place. He went into the army because he didn&rsquo;t have the best grades in school and still wanted to make something of himself. I pray that he&rsquo;ll come back safely. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it&rsquo;d be like to buy him a beer and sit next to him at the bar and just bullshit. His birthday is in November&hellip;he&rsquo;ll be 21. I wish he didn&rsquo;t have to spend it over there. I admire the courage that he has had and for most of my life I have spent my time looking down at him but for the first time I really find myself being proud of the person he has become and truly looking up to him&hellip;and knowing that he really is something else. We have shared almost all of the same experiences throughout our lives&hellip;we&rsquo;re only a year and nine months apart, so before we moved out of the house&hellip;we went through all of the good times as well as traumatic experiences together. It is not until now that our paths are really being pried apart, though I believe we&rsquo;re still within sight of eachother&hellip;walking parallel&hellip;still walking within arms reach. Brothers always.</p>

			 <p>There is a misty rain outside. The first day of this type weather I&rsquo;ve seen since summer decided to exhale it&rsquo;s warm breath upon this lonely peninsula. The trees are motionless but still of a vibrant green, though the grass is patchy and brown in places, only healthy along lines that follow the underground tubes that spider-leg north from the house. The house is empty aside from myself and the dogs that have been anxiously awaiting everyone&rsquo;s return, looking out the window and whimpering at every sound in hopes that the next vehicle is that of their masters'. Everything is quiet now in this cluttered home with the only exception being the fans with their colorless, ominous, soft breathing.</p>
<p>Summer has almost come to a close; I can feel it. My emotions have painted with all the spectrum but more so with one or two favored colors these three months. Mostly greens and blues and happy colors that are warm and inviting. I&rsquo;m afraid of what the next 6 months will paint. I find myself lingering on that, almost in preparation for the dramatic change that humid-cold/hot summer climates entail. I missed one and a half winters in my journeys along the southern most regions of the country, mostly the gulf coast in naples which at worst got down to a chilly 60 degrees. Though, I might add, that after months and months of 95+ degree weather, 60 does feel rather brisk. Now I drive my winding road at night, to the corner to get cigarettes, with the windows down in my very worn out, humble vehicle. Fifty five degree breezes coming through the trees and off the river have never felt so good. But this is summer. And it&rsquo;s still a 55 degree breeze. A 55 degree breeze that is the &lsquo;low&rsquo; for the day. Soon it will be the &lsquo;high&rsquo; and the low will be well below freezing. The river will freeze, the windows of my little car will ice in the mornings and the blades of grass out front will be frosted well into afternoon until the sun has given all that it can for the two warmest hours of the day and from there, dies, only for the frost to catch up again. I&rsquo;ll see my breath in the air and it will remind me of my childhood when my brothers and I would pretend we were smoking cigarettes. Funny how I do smoke now. I would have never imagined doing it for real.</p>
<p>And then for the tundra. Mid-December until Early April will be the months I dread the most. The months that make your balls climb close to your body with their scrotum as tight as tanned leather. Shivering uncontrollably with teeth chattering. Inhuman conditions that often pose the question &ldquo;why had our naked-aped ancestors ever considered venturing into such a climate? Especially when there are places like Costa Rica and the northern extremities of the Baja Peninsula.&rdquo; Places where you could where no skins. Places where you could be as naked as the day you were born and never know the discontent of 7ft high drifts of snow.</p>
<p>Though there are three good things that I can think of off the top of my head that I would consider somewhat positive outcomes to having drastic seasons. 1. Its a good divider of time and it&rsquo;s easier to place time frames in your life when it&rsquo;s separated by seasons. My memories of southern florida all blend into one unified, sweaty memory. 2. It brings people close together because if you&rsquo;re not doing something aerobic outside, it&rsquo;s just too damn cold to be out. Everybody comes indoors to drink, play, have symposiums of sorts&hellip;and try to stay warm with company, cheers and fireplaces. 3. Looking outside after an ice storm and looking at the trees that are encased in glass seems almost too beautiful to be reality.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what this entry is really supposed to be. I guess I&rsquo;m just letting stuff out. I&rsquo;ll close.</p>
