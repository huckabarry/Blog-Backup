				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>The strangeness of putting yourself out there. The mere act of expressing that you indeed have social needs, that you crave the connection of others, is one that creates repulsion, in myself (and seemingly <em>with</em> others). The effort required almost makes the desired outcome somehow less desirable.¬†</p>\n<p>Even in social situations of late, there is something different in the way we all speak to one another, something missing from the way things used to be. We are all tired, we are all distracted. Going through the motions. Feeding each other the requisite smalltalk. Single-serving ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.</p>\n<p>Someone converted a dating app into one for making friendships. All you do is swipe right, how hard could it be? Except even if a connection is made, there isn‚Äôt enough time or energy to put in any effort in responding. Astonishing? Perhaps. Surprising? No.¬†</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs easy to start to question what you have to offer the world, other people. That rabbit hole of self-analysis can engulf you too, if you‚Äôre not careful. To dilute all human interaction as transactional, conditional. To begin to see others as if through a small clerk‚Äôs window where someone on the other side is always expecting you to dance, or to make them laugh, or to provide them with some other entertainment or pleasure or connection.¬†</p>\n<p>I start to question if I really even want what I think I want. The current assignment is to find shared activities and friendships will bloom naturally. I‚Äôm tired and retreat inward. Find comfort in others who might as well be fictional people on a screen.¬†</p>\n<p>‚ÄúMaybe I should sign up for a class,‚Äù I tell myself. Start writing more and care less about what others think. Maybe that‚Äôs what losers tell themselves, I think.¬†</p>\n<p>Going through my memory of the people whose social lives you envied, the people who seemed to be a spiderweb of connection between everyone and everything. They all had something in common. They were the people who showed up to everything. Had dinner parties. Volunteered on boards and commissions. Went to happy hours. Played adult group sports. I remember one in particular falling asleep at the table while we ate dinner at her house. But everybody loved them. I still think fondly.¬†</p>\n<p>This is certainly all my fault, the loneliness. Who else made the decisions that got me to where I am? ¬†I‚Äôm not carving out enough ‚Äúme time‚Äù. I retreat inward. Find comfort in others who might as well be fictional people on a screen.¬†</p>\n<p>Wait, no. It‚Äôs our environment. The American built environment is killing us. The suburbs, it‚Äôs all their fault. It‚Äôs just middle age, this is normal. It‚Äôs the children, they take up too much of our time. It‚Äôs other men. All they want to do is talk about sports and play golf. Right? Female friends, wouldn‚Äôt that be great? Oh wait. We can‚Äôt form new, close relationships with women at this stage of life. They‚Äôll think you‚Äôre a creep. Trying to pull something on them and sneak around behind your wife. What will be people think?¬†</p>\n<p>Why do you need anything more than you already have? Isn‚Äôt that a sign of insecurity, of weakness?¬†</p>\n<p>I retreat inward.¬†</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I‚Äôm about a week in with CICO (calories in, calories out), and although it hasn‚Äôt exactly been easy, I‚Äôve stayed below my calorie limit all but 1 day. I‚Äôm still well below my restriction limit for the week, which means I did better than my expected.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôve set a goal of reducing my caloric intake by 800-1000 calories per day below my Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), which I calculated to be about 3200 calories depending on my physical activity. I've budgeted a little bit more calories for the weekends because I know I tend to eat breakfast or have the occasioanl beer.</p>\n<p>I know a lot of it has to be water weight, but I'm down about 6 pounds this week. I know this will level out, and so long as I stay on track, I could lose about 2 pounds per week.</p>\n<p>The most difficult part so far is the evening snacking. I‚Äôm noticing my biggest cravings are in the evening. I‚Äôve been trying to eat dense, low calorie foods like carrots.</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm also finding that I feel a lot more human if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast. Breaking up 2,200-2,400 calories over 3 meals and snacks just seems to be not that much food at a meal for my body size. I do still eat breakfast occasionally, but I‚Äôm much more mindful of how many calories I‚Äôm eating and try to keep it low with a hard boiled egg instead of cereal, which would push me way over the edge.</p>\n<p>Even though I'm aiming for 2 pounds per week, my goal is to lose 5 lbs per month until new years, for a total of 25 lbs. From what I‚Äôve been reading, this should be attainable, but never having dropped that much weight before, I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm planning on updating this blog to log my progress. I‚Äôll check in again next week to write an update about how things have been going.</p>\n",

				"title": "Garden Notions",
				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-0541-original.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For the last five years or so, I‚Äôve used the space next to my driveway for raised beds. I‚Äôve got a 3,100 gallon rain cistern in my backyard and I hand dug a trench to the front yard for my drip irrigation system.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-2157.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs worked pretty well, but there are pros and cons. For starters, the beds are pretty close to the driveway, and my wife already ripped my bumper off once and tried to pass it off as if nothing ever happened (I caught it on camera). That was just a one-off incident, thankfully.</p>\n<p>Another negative is that I‚Äôve had kids cutting through my side yard on the way to the light rail or on their way home from school. They‚Äôve trampled my pumpkins and zucchini squash a handful of times, and it‚Äôs pretty annoying to have put in so much work to grow a few healthy plants from seed only to have them trampled under foot by a careless teenagers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-1095.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I‚Äôve also had little old ladies stop by and help themselves to some tomatoes, which isn‚Äôt a huge concern, but it does feel a little weird to know my neighbors regularly steal from my garden. I‚Äôd gladly give them the food if they‚Äôd just ask. In fact, I‚Äôve put extra food out with a ‚Äútake me‚Äù sign before.</p>\n<p>But really, I‚Äôd like to use that space along my driveway for something else someday. I‚Äôve had this crazy idea for a while now to make our house look a bit like an old craftsman by converting the garage into living space and a front porch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-9449.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If we do decide to go through with the renovation, I‚Äôd like to shift our driveway to the right to make room for a walkway to the entrance. Since our backyard is so shaded, that leaves my front lawn as a new location for our garden beds. This poses a couple of issues though.</p>\n<p>First, I‚Äôd have to get the beds moved pretty soon; something I‚Äôm not really looking forward to doing in the dead of rainy season. Another issue is the situation with the rain cistern and having to figure out a new solution since the underground pipes can‚Äôt really traverse the underside of the driveway and would need to go around the other side ‚Äî loads of work that could be done later, but a job I don‚Äôt want to do.

				"content_text": "![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-0541-original.jpeg)\n\nFor the last five years or so, I‚Äôve used the space next to my driveway for raised beds. I‚Äôve got a 3,100 gallon rain cistern in my backyard and I hand dug a trench to the front yard for my drip irrigation system.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-2157.png)\n\nIt‚Äôs worked pretty well, but there are pros and cons. For starters, the beds are pretty close to the driveway, and my wife already ripped my bumper off once and tried to pass it off as if nothing ever happened (I caught it on camera). That was just a one-off incident, thankfully. \n\nAnother negative is that I‚Äôve had kids cutting through my side yard on the way to the light rail or on their way home from school. They‚Äôve trampled my pumpkins and zucchini squash a handful of times, and it‚Äôs pretty annoying to have put in so much work to grow a few healthy plants from seed only to have them trampled under foot by a careless teenagers. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-1095.jpeg)\n\nI‚Äôve also had little old ladies stop by and help themselves to some tomatoes, which isn‚Äôt a huge concern, but it does feel a little weird to know my neighbors regularly steal from my garden. I‚Äôd gladly give them the food if they‚Äôd just ask. In fact, I‚Äôve put extra food out with a ‚Äútake me‚Äù sign before. \n\nBut really, I‚Äôd like to use that space along my driveway for something else someday. I‚Äôve had this crazy idea for a while now to make our house look a bit like an old craftsman by converting the garage into living space and a front porch. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-9449.jpeg)\n\nIf we do decide to go through with the renovation, I‚Äôd like to shift our driveway to the right to make room for a walkway to the entrance. Since our backyard is so shaded, that leaves my front lawn as a new location for our garden beds. This poses a couple of issues though. \n\nFirst, I‚Äôd have to get the beds moved pretty soon; something I‚Äôm not really looking forward to doing in the dead of rainy season. Another issue is the situation with the rain cistern and having to figure out a new solution since the underground pipes can‚Äôt really traverse the underside of the driveway and would need to go around the other side ‚Äî loads of work that could be done later, but a job I don‚Äôt want to do. Finally, there‚Äôs the issue of my lawn and the appropriate way to retire it without making my yard a complete mess and nuisance. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2024/img-1034.jpeg)\n\nI‚Äôm not sure I have the time, energy, budget, or motivation to tackle all of this. It‚Äôs a hobby, and one I quite enjoy, but the food is merely supplemental and the cost-benefit ratio can get out of hand fairly quickly if one‚Äôs not careful. Yet I don‚Äôt want to give it up.\n\nMaybe some interim solutions will present themselves in my brainstorming, but right now, I‚Äôm coming up short as to how best to approach the issue. \n\n\n",

				"title": "Reflections on my quit anniversary and the new year",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->",
				"content_text": "<p>I had my last cigarette 7 years ago yesterday. Since that time, I've saved something like $25,000 in direct costs and have hopefully added years to my life. I don't write about this anniversary for praise or pats on the back, but instead to honor myself and explore my own feelings on the subject, which are complex. </p><!--more--><p>Avoiding lung cancer and saving money are of course two of the biggest motivations most people cite for wanting to quit smoking. But what nonsmokers might not realize is that many smokers experience profound psychological stress about their addiction, which in my case was what ultimately motivated me enough to successfully quit for good. I wanted to write a bit about this experience.</p><p>Over the course of my life, I've heard countless people express their disdain for smokers, writing off nicotine addiction as a mere habit. These same people paint smokers with a broad brush, characterizing them as low-life, selfish people who could quit at any time if only they'd exhibit a little self control and motivation. I think this thought process is severely flawed and shows incredible ignorance. While some people can more easily quit than others, this is rare and fails to take into account epigenetic and environmental differences. </p><p>It's well documented that nicotine is highly addictive, and the human brain changes dramatically as a result of its continued use. For example, nicotine receptors increase over time and addicted smokers have billions (yes, billions) more nicotine receptors than non-smokers, making it increasingly difficult to quit the longer one smokes. Furthermore, this deep chemical addiction causes new neural pathways to form in the brain as a result behavioral associations, reinforcing the chemical addiction. </p><p>It's a fact that most smokers want to quit, but the vast majority are unsuccessful. For example, around 70% of U.S. smokers say they would like to quit, while 55% have actually attempted quitting in the last year but have failed. As a result of this intense desire to quit, it's not uncommon for smokers to live in denial of the bodily harm being caused by the simple act of inhaling and exhaling smoke hundreds of times per day. For me, this denial was a defense mechanism against the deep existential dread I would feel if allowed to dwell on the reality of my addiction.</p><p>Perhaps even more depressing is that smoking addiction in low-income populations perpetuates intergenerational poverty and poor mental health outcomes. This is because low-income smokers will prioritize smoking over getting higher order human needs and goals met, such as the human needs for safety, food, social belonging, love, and self-esteem, or life goals such as improving their economic situation. Although the bodily harm caused by smoking is much slower than hard drugs, its legality and availability at every corner store makes it virtually impossible to break free.</p>\n<p>In my own case, the cognitive dissonance I experienced over 15 years of failed attempts to quit was intense and certainly took a mental and financial toll. Like other smokers, I desperately wanted to quit, not just to improve my health, but to improve my life. I felt that smoking was the major hurdle to reaching my goals and life potential, but I just couldn't get off the treadmill. At one point in my 20s, I was making around $6.50 per hour and was charging my cigarettes to a high interest credit card (25% APY) that ultimately had around $2,000 on it at its highest point ($3500 in today's dollars).</p>\n<p>The life consequences beyond health impacts were real as well. Being a smoker severely limited my relationships, most notably my career and dating prospects, and I internalized that as both shame and resentment. Consequently, I went to great lengths to hide that I was a smoker, especially from those for whom I had great respect or romantic interest. I would wear nicotine patches before and during job interviews or dates, trying to keep the smell of smoke off of me, only to light up immediately afterword. I gained a reputation among friends and colleagues as being aloof and clandestine as I frequently absconded from work and social situations to sneak in a cigarette. It's all really silly to me now, but mostly it's just sad that it had such a hold on me. </p><p>Now that I've quit, I certainly enjoy no longer smelling like an ashtray and not having to hide parts of myself from coworkers and other people due to embarrassment. I no longer feel like a pariah. I don't lose my breath going up a few flights of stairs. I probably sleep better. I can certainly tell the vast improvement to my breathing. But there have also been negative consequences as a result of quitting, too. </p><p>Most notably, I have gained quite a bit of weight. I was always a healthy weight as a smoker but I gained 40 lbs after quitting, pushing me into the obese category. This has taken its toll on my self-esteem, energy, and motivation. I have also noticed changes in how people treat me as a result of my physical changes, which can be pretty sad thinking how superficial our world has become. </p><p>I'm proud of myself, but my next goal is to continue working on my mindset. In 2024, I want to work on self acceptance while making small but steady improvements in my physical health through achievable goals and habits. And for those on a similar journey, I wish you strength, health and wellness in the new year. </p><p></p><p></p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>I'm just not feeling the holiday spirit this year. Both my kids are young and I am trying to show up for them. I even saved up quite a bit of cash to pay for toys and gifts and take some of that stress off us, but I just can't get in the mood. </p><p>I think more than anything, I'm feeling tired of Oregon and feeling the pull to move back to Michigan. We‚Äôve outgrown our house and feel trapped due to prices and interest rates. Looking at real estate back in the Midwest looks like a bargain. The pay isn‚Äôt even that different in my field, and we‚Äôd have a huge down payment if we sold our current house to buy there. It‚Äôs even more appealing to me also because my family lives there. But I can‚Äôt convince my wife. </p><p>Take for example this house:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1290\" height=\"1517\" srcset=\"https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 600w, https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 1000w, https://notes.bryan.lv/content/images/2023/12/IMG_9863-1.jpeg 1290w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>It‚Äôs in an affluent suburb with good schools, in a major metro area with good jobs in my field. A house like this barely even exists in Oregon, and the ones that do would cost double what this one is listed for. Here in Oregon, we live in a tiny place in a less desirable location despite being in a higher income group. It‚Äôs crazy to me what is unavailable to us given our education and income levels. We worked so hard to get where we are and barely feel we can get ahead. Why people stay here is beyond me. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<p>It‚Äôs been a busy couple of weeks. But I guess life is just sort of busy now anyways. In no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The weather has officially turned over to Fall and we‚Äôve been getting a lot more rain lately. I don‚Äôt mind it yet and the cooler weather has been a welcome change. The next couple of days are supposed to be sunny and I‚Äôm looking forward to it.¬†</li>\n<li>My kids and I went to the big box home improvement store and picked up a bunch of Halloween decorations. I dipped into some savings for Christmas because my son is all about this holiday. We got a little witch that dances and sings, a skeleton dog, a fun wreath, and some headstones and dirt to make our front garden box look like a graveyard. It‚Äôs so much fun seeing these things through the eyes of a 4-year-old. My daughter is about 20 months and she isn‚Äôt quite as into them yet. In fact, she‚Äôs a bit freaked out by the witch :D.</li>\n<li>The pumpkins I grew did turn orange! I cut them off their vines a few weeks ago and made sure they got lots of sunshine. The largest of the two turned all the way orange and the smaller one is still a little green, but it made me happy to see they had actually turned because I wasn‚Äôt sure if they would.¬†</li>\n<li>I started constructing a Mystery Machine (Scooby-Doo) out of boxes I‚Äôd procured, just shaping them into a van for now. This week I promised my son we‚Äôd paint it. I already got the paint from Joann last weekend, just looking for the time to get it started before Halloween. The idea is that I‚Äôll place it on our wagon and take it with us Trick-or-Treating.¬†</li>\n<li>This past weekend we checked out a new park in Hillsboro that has a giant troll play structure constructed out of wood. The kids of course loved it. This area really does have a lot to do for kids and is really family friendly.¬†</li>\n<li>My son and I got our Flu shots early last week and my wife took our daughter to do the same. Still have to schedule our Covid boosters. P was running around the doctor‚Äôs office and crawling around on the floor. The hospital staff didn‚Äôt know what to make of it. I just shrugged and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs 4‚Äù.¬†</li>\n<li>Last week I was busy cleaning up files and finishing some last minute projects as I was exiting my last role at work, and this week I officially started my new job within a different department. It‚Äôs still early, but so far &#8211; so good, and the people are really nice. It‚Äôs a very different world from what I‚Äôm used to, but I welcome the change.¬†</li>\n<li>I bought a treadmill and have been keeping up with using it just about every day, sometimes in the morning and other times in the evening. My wife, who was skeptical at first, is even using it a bit herself. I‚Äôve just been throwing on a podcast or some Italian music (I‚Äôm trying to learn) or a show and going to town for 30 minutes to an hour. Nothing too intense yet, but I‚Äôd really started to feel like my body was working against me lately and figured I‚Äôd gone long enough with not having a more regular routine. Hoping I can keep this going and maintain a good, healthy habit. I feel like I‚Äôm sleeping better and my mood is improving, too.¬†</li>\n<li>I spoke to my mom a few days ago about her and my dad watching out kids while we go to Europe, hopefully in the spring. Sounds like they are definitely up for coming out to Portland and holding down the fort, which would be awesome. A little scary considering we‚Äôve never left our kids for that long, but my wife and I are pretty much on our own out here without much support from family. It will be good for us to do something for ourselves, however strange that aspect may be. Having had that conversation, I feel like we can finally start planning it for real. I would like to visit my ancestral homeland of Vigo di Cadore, Veneto, Italy for starters. Shar seems really excited to be checking out the Dolomites as there‚Äôs lots of good hiking to do. We haven‚Äôt decided where else we might go, but that‚Äôs top of the list.¬†</li>\n<li>I‚Äôve never watched too much sports, but I got an ESPN subscription for this winter because apparently the Lions are actually doing pretty well and I‚Äôd like to watch this as it‚Äôs never occurred in my entire life. My son and I watched the Red Wings last night and they won, 4-0 against the Blue Jackets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<!--kg-card-end: html-->\n",

				"content_text": "<ul>\n<li>The kids are watching a movie (Spy Kids: Armageddon) and my wife is off with her girlfriends paddle boarding. We‚Äôre winding down after a somewhat stressful week while DW gets some much needed time for herself.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I finished a big report I was writing for work early in the week, a few weeks early no less, so I feel like I can release some of the extra anxiety that has been burdening me unnecessarily. I‚Äôve also been waiting on some pretty important work news since May and I still haven‚Äôt gotten any word about it. As a result, I haven‚Äôt been sleeping the best again and it‚Äôs made for some tougher days than normal, especially with the kids.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>My daughter was sick and throwing up earlier in the week, so I ended up not working on Tuesday and just taking care of her. It was nice to spend some one-on-one time with her like I did with my son when he was her age. She got over her stomach bug pretty quickly, thankfully.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I actually picked up a couple new pieces of clothing. I have a habit of not spending much money on myself in this respect. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm surprised when I look back at pictures from a few years ago and see myself wearing something that is still in my current wardrobe. So this week I made it a point to go through my things and pull out some stuff that I‚Äôm not super thrilled to be wearing anymore and bagged it up to donate. I went up to Marshall‚Äôs and actually found a pair of jeans from a brand I like (Madewell) for about 1/5th the cost of new. I like this brand because they don‚Äôt use logos and the cuts seem to fit me well.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>It‚Äôs the last day of summer and my favorite time of the year in this part of the world. We‚Äôve been having some pretty clear days, which have been fairly warm and clear but not too hot. Rain is on the horizon, so I‚Äôm soaking it up.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Halloween is right around the corner and we are all planning on going around the neighborhood dressed up as the Mystery Inc. gang from Scooby-Doo. I am wanting to construct a Mystery Machine out of cardboard, some paint, and a wagon. So I should probably get started on that maybe this weekend. My son and I picked up some decorations from Home Depot, including a nearly full-size skeleton that we hung on the front of the house. I‚Äôm also growing some pumpkins for the very first time. The largest of the two appears to be slowly turning orange.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I am feeling pretty good heading into the holidays coming up. I have been diligent about putting away a little money here and there for Christmas so we can hopefully just enjoy the season and not stress out about money or over-extending ourselves and putting things on credit. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>I got a few small things done around the house despite not getting my drywalling project in the kitchen done. I swapped out the valve for the bathroom shower so it no longer drip drip drips! I also fixed the door to my daughter‚Äôs room so it doesn‚Äôt stick when you open or close it. This was a pain when we‚Äôd just put her to bed and the door would squeak when we attempted to leave the room, sometimes waking her up. Used a huge 6‚Äù cabinet screw in place of a hinge screw to bring it truer. Good to have these small annoyances taken care of. Hoping to make more progress on the drywall project this week.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2023/fa099e1416.jpg\" />\n\n<p>I had a flashback this morning as I was getting the kids ready for school that reminded me of a time in my life when everything was so unsettled and chaotic. This seems to happen to me a lot more whenever summer starts to give way to fall, when I can smell the change of season in the air and the evenings get a little bit shorter. The memories of back-to-school anxiousness come flooding back and I get a pang somewhere in the recesses of my brain. Usually I‚Äôm transported back to being 13 and crying in the dressing room at Sears while trying on school clothes, but today‚Äôs memory was different.¬†</p>\n<p>A couple of decades ago, after my third term at an enormous university, I flunked out of engineering school. It used to be a pretty big source of embarrassment for me, but after many years of learning about myself, I've come to understand the difficulties I experienced then were less a personal failure than they were the very obvious result of my crippling anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD. I no longer look at that time negatively, but rather an inflection point in my life when I had begun to understand myself better.¬†</p>\n<p>For the next two and a half years after dropping out, I worked various service jobs and other menial labor for minimum wage, which was $5.15 per hour. I had worked as a pantry cook, gas station attendant, cell phone sales rep, water purification system sales rep, surf and skate shop associate, and I even working for an asbestos abatement contractor one summer. I was always broke and things weren‚Äôt going so great, to say the least. Often I found myself wondering what could have been and fell into a major depression.¬†</p>\n<p>There were a few more twists and turns over this time period that I won‚Äôt get into here, but this week marks the 20-year anniversary of me going back to school and restarting my educational journey at a community college. After two years there, I transferred back to university and finished a bachelor‚Äôs degree, only to find myself working in a kitchen again because of the Great Recession. During this time, I applied to graduate programs. I was accepted at a top 3 public university, and a couple of years later I received my master‚Äôs degree in urban planning. As a result of that, I was finally able to gain a foothold in some meaningful work that actually paid a living wage at the ripe old age of 29. And the rest is history, or so they say.¬†</p>\n<p>I likely would have avoided a lot of this hardship had I had financial support, well-connected parents, or even health insurance and medication for my anxiety. However, the fact that I did it on my own is a great source of pride now. I look back fondly at my time at community college. In a lot of ways, it was my best higher ed experience of all three I attended. But more than that, it laid the groundwork for the life I love now.¬†</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Normally I try to keep things fairly light and impersonal here. I may tend toward the dark or sarcastic from time to time, but over all, I‚Äôm usually a pretty happy person. However, lately I‚Äôve been feeling a little more easily bruised, overly sensitive, and just generally melancholy. I‚Äôve been wanting to write a little more at length in hopes of lifting some of the weight up off from me, but life‚Äôs been pretty busy lately up until right now. And so here I find myself after some dust has settled.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôve just joined me, or stumbled across this place, my blog, or even if you‚Äôre just passively following me from some federated service, you'll probably want to take a pass on reading any more of this post. Fair warning: this is just my petty ramblings for my own personal therapy, nothing more.¬†</p>\n<p>So, as I said, I‚Äôve been experiencing some mild depression lately. This is pretty out of character for me given that it‚Äôs mid-summer. It's not the same old SAD-induced stuff I‚Äôm used to experiencing in brief episodes during the wintertime when I‚Äôve long been trapped indoors for weeks and Vitamin D deficient. My skin has been sun-drenched and the evenings have been long. By most accounts, I shouldn‚Äôt feel like I do.¬†</p>\n<p>Although nothing super weighty has happened in my life recently, I‚Äôm coming out of a few bad years. I thought I got through most of my feelings, but my grief still pokes its head out from time to time, and sometimes smaller things add up to more than their constituent parts, especially when they're piled up on top of that previous stuff.</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs been bothering me more recently, for example, is that some summer plans have just not gone so well. I took my four-year-old son to Michigan recently to celebrate my step-dad‚Äôs 60th birthday. And to be completely honest, I didn‚Äôt really want to go at first and had to really rally and build up my motivation because the last several trips home haven‚Äôt been the most positive experiences.</p>\n<p>For example, a few years ago I flew back home in support of my mom when she was going through post-op chemo for breast cancer. I went back again a couple of years later in 2021 when my brother went into hospice, where he then died a couple weeks later from the brain tumor he had been fighting since being diagnosed in 2014. Then, last year, some drama unfolded between my youngest (living) brother and his now ex-wife over some custody issues with my nephew, all while my whole family was there vacationing.</p>\n<p>So, I might be excused from not being totally thrilled at the prospect of returning. Although much of it was well beyond anyone‚Äôs control, it sometimes feels like bad energy just surrounds the place, and I‚Äôve begun to dread going ‚Äòhome‚Äô for these kinds of visits because something is always.going.down. My wife even refused to go back this year given past years' experiences, so she stayed here in Oregon with our daughter.</p>\n<p>Despite all this, I did my very best to put my negative feelings aside, for my dad‚Äôs sake, but also for my son, who still hadn‚Äôt met any of his cousins yet. So I put on my game face and tried my best to just roll with it. And it all really had been going pretty well, too, until about halfway through the trip when I had an argument with my brother and my parents.</p>\n<p>It started when I had something come up at work while we were up at their RV park vacation home, so I had to finish a few things remotely. No big deal. I had already discussed with my parents that I‚Äôd have to work a little on this trip, so it wasn‚Äôt completely unexpected. They were just happy we were there.</p>\n<p>So when this bit of work came up, my dad asked if he could bring my son down to the beach for a while. I agreed, enthusiastically. My dad‚Äôs a great guy and really good with the grandkids. We had just been to the beach the day before and we all had a great time. I figured it would be great bonding time for all of them. Thumbs up. So away they went.¬†</p>\n<p>When I finished my work about an hour later, I walked down to the beach to join them. At first, I thought everyone had left because I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone there. But then I noticed my son‚Äôs voice from afar. Surprised, I saw that he was swimming a long ways from shore. And although he was wearing a life jacket, he was about 35-40 feet out from the beach, essentially unsupervised.</p>\n<p>It turned out that my dad had left to take a friend back to camp and he put my brother in charge over my son. However, my brother wasn‚Äôt anywhere within line-of-site of my son when I arrived. He was in the water, but on the other side of a floating dock, completely out of view. My son, who cannot swim, was playing by himself in 15 feet of water without an adult watching over him.¬†</p>\n<p>How long had he been out there? How long had no one been watching him? I struggled to make sense of what was going on. At first, I gave my brother the benefit of the doubt. I just watched. With me there watching, I knew my son wasn‚Äôt in any real danger, but I observed to see who was paying attention. As time went on, it became clear that my four-year-old son was really out there all on his own.</p>\n<p>No one was paying any attention to him for at least the 5 minutes I was observing, long enough for something to go horribly wrong. I watched long enough for me to have seen my 4-year-old son struggle to get out of the way of other kids much older and larger than him, playing and jumping off the floating dock in his vicinity. Some kids were jumping right over his head, and he showed signs of struggling to stay above water. It was at this point that I called to him to shore, my brother still out of view on the other side of the floating dock.</p>\n<p>Once back to shore, I kept my cool and didn‚Äôt yell, but I told my brother in a bit of an upset tone that my son shouldn‚Äôt have been that far out, and that he definitely shouldn‚Äôt be left unattended like that. He quickly got offended by this, arguing that my son wasn‚Äôt unattended. He acted as if it would‚Äôve been impossible for anything to happen to him while wearing a life jacket.</p>\n<p>I just couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. The icing on the cake was when my brother said something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome for entertaining your kid for the last couple of hours.‚Äù This just left me feeling very hot given that I had just spent 5 hours with his son without my brother the day prior, like he was doing me some enormous favor by spending an hour with my son, his nephew. I know he was just deflecting the fact that he failed to provide the most basic level of care and oversight to my son.¬†</p>\n<p>I was upset at him, but more than anything, I was upset with my dad for his negligence. Later, my brother told me that my dad didn‚Äôt even tell him that he was leaving. I was flabbergasted. My dad‚Äôs brother died by drowning at the age of 18, so this fact surprised me even more.</p>\n<p>To top things off, my parents sided with my brother, and my dad basically denied any wrongdoing. My mom has always been protective of my youngest brother, but this was just over the top. She blamed me for stirring up things unnecessarily.¬†</p>\n<p>I went over the situation again and again in my head to analyze whether I had done something wrong or if I had overreacted. I felt like I was being gaslighted. I wanted to leave, but I was trapped because I was far out in the country and didn‚Äôt have a car. And to make matters worse, my dad‚Äôs 60th birthday party was to be the next day, the entire purpose for the trip.¬†</p>\n<p>Thank God nothing happened to my son, but I kept coming back to those first few moments when I saw him out there in the water alone. My stomach turns at the thought. But to be made to doubt the own validity of my feelings instead of acknowledging a mistake and just apologizing? I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that this experience had me looking back and questioning my own upbringing.¬†</p>\n<p>It all left me feeling completely disappointed and disrespected by people I thought had more common sense than this, people whom I thought I could trust. I am still working through a lot of feelings about it.</p>\n<p>I spent the evening and much of the rest of the next day removing myself from the situation, staying in another camper. The following evening, I smoothed things over with my brother for the good of the order. It felt like I was lying to myself in doing so, but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my dad‚Äôs big event. I‚Äôm still feeling deeply hurt by what went down and I‚Äôm having trouble trying to figure out how I can move forward given that it‚Äôs gone completely unacknowledged since.¬†</p>\n<p>I left Michigan still pretty salty, but was trying to forget about it, focus on the positive, and look forward to a camping trip I had planned on the Oregon coast the following week‚Äîthis past weekend. I booked the trip six <em>months</em> ago because state parks open up their registration that far in advance and the good places fill up pretty much instantly out here in Oregon (maybe it‚Äôs the same elsewhere, too). I knew the trip would be difficult with a young family, but I really thought we would have a lot of fun, too. Turns out we were not ready for that kind of trip.¬†</p>\n<p>After days of preparation and loading the van to the roof liner, it was five hours by car until we reached our destination. My first mistake. My one-year-old daughter screamed and cried for at least half of that trip downstate, likely setting some kind of record, but also laying the groundwork for a pretty rough trip.</p>\n<p>Both kids thankfully fell asleep right before we got there, which allowed me and my wife to setup camp fairly quickly and undisturbed. We thought we had gotten over the hump, that we could just enjoy our time there, but unfortunately we were wrong.</p>\n<p>The coast ended up being pretty cold at night, dropping down into the upper 40s and low 50s, but it was the 35 mph wind gusts that really did us in. My wife, who had on several layers of clothes, a sleeping bag, and blankets, couldn‚Äôt handle the cold. Then, my daughter kept waking up periodically throughout the night before waking up permanently at between 4 and 5 a.m. each morning. As a result, we were all pretty miserable the entire time despite being in such a beautiful place. After two nights of that, we promptly packed up the van and checked ourselves into the nearest Best Western.¬†</p>\n<p>For the most part, that went a lot better, albeit with an underlying air of defeat that permeated everything we did the remainder of the trip. Still, $500 later, we had a pool, a hot tub, and a couple warm beds to sleep in. But that wasn‚Äôt the end of it.</p>\n<p>Everywhere we went, the kid (my daughter) screamed. Hour trip up the 101 for a hike? Screaming child. Trying to grab some grub at a local brewery with great food and beer? Fussy, crying, screaming child. Spending time at the beach? Screaming child. I think she had just had enough of the road trip life. We all did. I lost my cool at one point and raised my voice, which I regret, feeling completely wiped myself. Most ironically, my son had a great time through all of it and didn‚Äôt want it to end. But for me, these experiences have made me want to stay home for the next couple of <em>years</em>.</p>\n<p>I would sometimes think how great it was that I had the opportunity to really plan for my family. That unlike my mom, who was thrust into motherhood as a teenager, I started a family in my late 30s because I had lived so much, settled into my career, and was so financially stable. But then other times, I am just so completely drained that I think I must have been crazy to think this would be easier.</p>\n<p>At any rate, the month of July can go to hell. I will remain within a 15 mile radius for the foreseeable future. I love my family and I love my life, but this summer is testing me. Until next time.¬†</p>\n<p>Love, Dad</p>\n",

Six houses separated us from a very poor inner-city school. \n\nSometimes, I‚Äôm amazed by what some of the neighborhood kids grew up to become given their home environments, especially compared to some of the kids who were inside the city‚Äôs school district. Several kids who grew up on my street, including myself, have graduate degrees. One of my closest friends as a kid is an attorney in Chicago. \n\nIt‚Äôs sad to think schools can have such disparate impacts on kids. The families on either side of the line weren‚Äôt any different from ours in terms of socioeconomic status. \n\nAs a humanitarian, as a city planner, I wish we could solve the problem of our schools. Good, properly funded schools would go a long way toward solving so many of our societal ills. I think a decent education, along with affordable healthcare for all, are human rights, and the bare minimum any wealthy society should provide to its citizens. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92110/2023/media.jpg\" />\n",

Blame it on my blue collar Midwestern upbringing.¬†I‚Äôve invested a lot of sweat into the thing. I have an emotional attachment to the place.¬†</p>\n<p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs still a lot to do. It‚Äôs still got some pretty ugly laminate flooring downstairs and an old, dated kitchen from the 80s. And there are a few partially completed projects around the house. Those don't bother me too much, although I'm certain my wife might have something to say about that (she says we're not buying another house that isn't \"done\" -- I don't have the heart to tell her that it's not ever \"done\"). </p>\n<p>What bothers me is that it can feel like the walls are closing in on me now that we‚Äôre a family of four. Our house is 1300 square feet and it feels like we‚Äôre always right on top of one another. But for us to move into a larger house, we‚Äôd be looking at tripling our house payment.</p>\n<p>The plus side of this is that our housing costs are very low. Most of the houses like ours are selling for about double what we paid. Our monthly housing costs are one-half to one-third of what many of our friends pay. For now, this is suiting us fine, especially considering that we have two children in daycare that costs us a couple thousand dollars per month</p>\n<p>Some other financial positives are that, as a result of keeping our housing costs low, we‚Äôre able to save 20% for retirement and also put away a few hundred dollars per month for the kids‚Äô college funds. We don‚Äôt have a lot left over at the end of the month, but we have an emergency fund that we almost never have to touch and don‚Äôt have to budget every penny we have.¬†</p>\n<p>We don‚Äôt have any pressure to move except for our own desires. I‚Äôm trying hard to ignore my feelings, but I think social media hasn‚Äôt helped (one more reason to perhaps get off it). Since I come from a place where housing prices are way less, I get so see a lot of people back home posting photos of living in beautiful houses. I‚Äôm trying very hard to ignore my own jealous feelings and to deny my very American drive toward ‚Äúmore, more, more‚Äù, but on the other hand, why should it be so tough when we are considered upper middle class? I know we have so much more than most. I am grateful for what we have. Still, our homes are more than just backdrops, they frame so much of our daily lives. I am still trying to sort my feelings out on this stuff.</p>\n",
