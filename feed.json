				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It’s been a busy couple of weeks. But I guess life is just sort of busy now anyways. In no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The weather has officially turned over to Fall and we’ve been getting a lot more rain lately. I don’t mind it yet and the cooler weather has been a welcome change. The next couple of days are supposed to be sunny and I’m looking forward to it. </li>\n<li>My kids and I went to the big box home improvement store and picked up a bunch of Halloween decorations. I dipped into some savings for Christmas because my son is all about this holiday. We got a little witch that dances and sings, a skeleton dog, a fun wreath, and some headstones and dirt to make our front garden box look like a graveyard. It’s so much fun seeing these things through the eyes of a 4-year-old. My daughter is about 20 months and she isn’t quite as into them yet. In fact, she’s a bit freaked out by the witch :D.</li>\n<li>The pumpkins I grew did turn orange! I cut them off their vines a few weeks ago and made sure they got lots of sunshine. The largest of the two turned all the way orange and the smaller one is still a little green, but it made me happy to see they had actually turned because I wasn’t sure if they would. </li>\n<li>I started constructing a Mystery Machine (Scooby-Doo) out of boxes I’d procured, just shaping them into a van for now. This week I promised my son we’d paint it. I already got the paint from Joann last weekend, just looking for the time to get it started before Halloween. The idea is that I’ll place it on our wagon and take it with us Trick-or-Treating. </li>\n<li>This past weekend we checked out a new park in Hillsboro that has a giant troll play structure constructed out of wood. The kids of course loved it. This area really does have a lot to do for kids and is really family friendly. </li>\n<li>My son and I got our Flu shots early last week and my wife took our daughter to do the same. Still have to schedule our Covid boosters. P was running around the doctor’s office and crawling around on the floor. The hospital staff didn’t know what to make of it. I just shrugged and said “he’s 4”. </li>\n<li>Last week I was busy cleaning up files and finishing some last minute projects as I was exiting my last role at work, and this week I officially started my new job within a different department. It’s still early, but so far - so good, and the people are really nice. It’s a very different world from what I’m used to, but I welcome the change. </li>\n<li>I bought a treadmill and have been keeping up with using it just about every day, sometimes in the morning and other times in the evening. My wife, who was skeptical at first, is even using it a bit herself. I’ve just been throwing on a podcast or some Italian music (I’m trying to learn) or a show and going to town for 30 minutes to an hour. Nothing too intense yet, but I’d really started to feel like my body was working against me lately and figured I’d gone long enough with not having a more regular routine. Hoping I can keep this going and maintain a good, healthy habit. I feel like I’m sleeping better and my mood is improving, too. </li>\n<li>I spoke to my mom a few days ago about her and my dad watching out kids while we go to Europe, hopefully in the spring. Sounds like they are definitely up for coming out to Portland and holding down the fort, which would be awesome. A little scary considering we’ve never left our kids for that long, but my wife and I are pretty much on our own out here without much support from family. It will be good for us to do something for ourselves, however strange that aspect may be. Having had that conversation, I feel like we can finally start planning it for real. I would like to visit my ancestral homeland of Vigo di Cadore, Veneto, Italy for starters. Shar seems really excited to be checking out the Dolomites as there’s lots of good hiking to do. We haven’t decided where else we might go, but that’s top of the list. </li>\n<li>I’ve never watched too much sports, but I got an ESPN subscription for this winter because apparently the Lions are actually doing pretty well and I’d like to watch this as it’s never occurred in my entire life. My son and I watched the Red Wings last night and they won, 4-0 against the Blue Jackets.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<ul>\n<li>The kids are watching a movie (Spy Kids: Armageddon) and my wife is off with her girlfriends paddle boarding. We’re winding down after a somewhat stressful week while DW gets some much needed time for herself.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I finished a big report I was writing for work early in the week, a few weeks early no less, so I feel like I can release some of the extra anxiety that has been burdening me unnecessarily. I’ve also been waiting on some pretty important work news since May and I still haven’t gotten any word about it. As a result, I haven’t been sleeping the best again and it’s made for some tougher days than normal, especially with the kids.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>My daughter was sick and throwing up earlier in the week, so I ended up not working on Tuesday and just taking care of her. It was nice to spend some one-on-one time with her like I did with my son when he was her age. She got over her stomach bug pretty quickly, thankfully.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I actually picked up a couple new pieces of clothing. I have a habit of not spending much money on myself in this respect. I don’t know why I’m surprised when I look back at pictures from a few years ago and see myself wearing something that is still in my current wardrobe. So this week I made it a point to go through my things and pull out some stuff that I’m not super thrilled to be wearing anymore and bagged it up to donate. I went up to Marshall’s and actually found a pair of jeans from a brand I like (Madewell) for about 1/5th the cost of new. I like this brand because they don’t use logos and the cuts seem to fit me well.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>It’s the last day of summer and my favorite time of the year in this part of the world. We’ve been having some pretty clear days, which have been fairly warm and clear but not too hot. Rain is on the horizon, so I’m soaking it up.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Halloween is right around the corner and we are all planning on going around the neighborhood dressed up as the Mystery Inc. gang from Scooby-Doo. I am wanting to construct a Mystery Machine out of cardboard, some paint, and a wagon. So I should probably get started on that maybe this weekend. My son and I picked up some decorations from Home Depot, including a nearly full-size skeleton that we hung on the front of the house. I’m also growing some pumpkins for the very first time. The largest of the two appears to be slowly turning orange.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I am feeling pretty good heading into the holidays coming up. I have been diligent about putting away a little money here and there for Christmas so we can hopefully just enjoy the season and not stress out about money or over-extending ourselves and putting things on credit. <br /><br /></li>\n<li>I got a few small things done around the house despite not getting my drywalling project in the kitchen done. I swapped out the valve for the bathroom shower so it no longer drip drip drips! I also fixed the door to my daughter’s room so it doesn’t stick when you open or close it. This was a pain when we’d just put her to bed and the door would squeak when we attempted to leave the room, sometimes waking her up. Used a huge 6” cabinet screw in place of a hinge screw to bring it truer. Good to have these small annoyances taken care of. Hoping to make more progress on the drywall project this week.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/fa099e1416.jpg\" />\n\n<p>I had a flashback this morning as I was getting the kids ready for school that reminded me of a time in my life when everything was so unsettled and chaotic. This seems to happen to me a lot more whenever summer starts to give way to fall, when I can smell the change of season in the air and the evenings get a little bit shorter. The memories of back-to-school anxiousness come flooding back and I get a pang somewhere in the recesses of my brain. Usually I’m transported back to being 13 and crying in the dressing room at Sears while trying on school clothes, but today’s memory was different. </p>\n<p>A couple of decades ago, after my third term at an enormous university, I flunked out of engineering school. It used to be a pretty big source of embarrassment for me, but after many years of learning about myself, I've come to understand the difficulties I experienced then were less a personal failure than they were the very obvious result of my crippling anxiety and undiagnosed ADHD. I no longer look at that time negatively, but rather an inflection point in my life when I had begun to understand myself better. </p>\n<p>For the next two and a half years after dropping out, I worked various service jobs and other menial labor for minimum wage, which was $5.15 per hour. I had worked as a pantry cook, gas station attendant, cell phone sales rep, water purification system sales rep, surf and skate shop associate, and I even working for an asbestos abatement contractor one summer. I was always broke and things weren’t going so great, to say the least. Often I found myself wondering what could have been and fell into a major depression. </p>\n<p>There were a few more twists and turns over this time period that I won’t get into here, but this week marks the 20-year anniversary of me going back to school and restarting my educational journey at a community college. After two years there, I transferred back to university and finished a bachelor’s degree, only to find myself working in a kitchen again because of the Great Recession. During this time, I applied to graduate programs. I was accepted at a top 3 public university, and a couple of years later I received my master’s degree in urban planning. As a result of that, I was finally able to gain a foothold in some meaningful work that actually paid a living wage at the ripe old age of 29. And the rest is history, or so they say. </p>\n<p>I likely would have avoided a lot of this hardship had I had financial support, well-connected parents, or even health insurance and medication for my anxiety. However, the fact that I did it on my own is a great source of pride now. I look back fondly at my time at community college. In a lot of ways, it was my best higher ed experience of all three I attended. But more than that, it laid the groundwork for the life I love now. </p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Normally I try to keep things fairly light and impersonal here. I may tend toward the dark or sarcastic from time to time, but over all, I’m usually a pretty happy person. However, lately I’ve been feeling a little more easily bruised, overly sensitive, and just generally melancholy. I’ve been wanting to write a little more at length in hopes of lifting some of the weight up off from me, but life’s been pretty busy lately up until right now. And so here I find myself after some dust has settled.</p>\n<p>If you’ve just joined me, or stumbled across this place, my blog, or even if you’re just passively following me from some federated service, you'll probably want to take a pass on reading any more of this post. Fair warning: this is just my petty ramblings for my own personal therapy, nothing more. </p>\n<p>So, as I said, I’ve been experiencing some mild depression lately. This is pretty out of character for me given that it’s mid-summer. It's not the same old SAD-induced stuff I’m used to experiencing in brief episodes during the wintertime when I’ve long been trapped indoors for weeks and Vitamin D deficient. My skin has been sun-drenched and the evenings have been long. By most accounts, I shouldn’t feel like I do. </p>\n<p>Although nothing super weighty has happened in my life recently, I’m coming out of a few bad years. I thought I got through most of my feelings, but my grief still pokes its head out from time to time, and sometimes smaller things add up to more than their constituent parts, especially when they're piled up on top of that previous stuff.</p>\n<p>What’s been bothering me more recently, for example, is that some summer plans have just not gone so well. I took my four-year-old son to Michigan recently to celebrate my step-dad’s 60th birthday. And to be completely honest, I didn’t really want to go at first and had to really rally and build up my motivation because the last several trips home haven’t been the most positive experiences.</p>\n<p>For example, a few years ago I flew back home in support of my mom when she was going through post-op chemo for breast cancer. I went back again a couple of years later in 2021 when my brother went into hospice, where he then died a couple weeks later from the brain tumor he had been fighting since being diagnosed in 2014. Then, last year, some drama unfolded between my youngest (living) brother and his now ex-wife over some custody issues with my nephew, all while my whole family was there vacationing.</p>\n<p>So, I might be excused from not being totally thrilled at the prospect of returning. Although much of it was well beyond anyone’s control, it sometimes feels like bad energy just surrounds the place, and I’ve begun to dread going ‘home’ for these kinds of visits because something is always.going.down. My wife even refused to go back this year given past years' experiences, so she stayed here in Oregon with our daughter.</p>\n<p>Despite all this, I did my very best to put my negative feelings aside, for my dad’s sake, but also for my son, who still hadn’t met any of his cousins yet. So I put on my game face and tried my best to just roll with it. And it all really had been going pretty well, too, until about halfway through the trip when I had an argument with my brother and my parents.</p>\n<p>It started when I had something come up at work while we were up at their RV park vacation home, so I had to finish a few things remotely. No big deal. I had already discussed with my parents that I’d have to work a little on this trip, so it wasn’t completely unexpected. They were just happy we were there.</p>\n<p>So when this bit of work came up, my dad asked if he could bring my son down to the beach for a while. I agreed, enthusiastically. My dad’s a great guy and really good with the grandkids. We had just been to the beach the day before and we all had a great time. I figured it would be great bonding time for all of them. Thumbs up. So away they went. </p>\n<p>When I finished my work about an hour later, I walked down to the beach to join them. At first, I thought everyone had left because I didn’t recognize anyone there. But then I noticed my son’s voice from afar. Surprised, I saw that he was swimming a long ways from shore. And although he was wearing a life jacket, he was about 35-40 feet out from the beach, essentially unsupervised.</p>\n<p>It turned out that my dad had left to take a friend back to camp and he put my brother in charge over my son. However, my brother wasn’t anywhere within line-of-site of my son when I arrived. He was in the water, but on the other side of a floating dock, completely out of view. My son, who cannot swim, was playing by himself in 15 feet of water without an adult watching over him. </p>\n<p>How long had he been out there? How long had no one been watching him? I struggled to make sense of what was going on. At first, I gave my brother the benefit of the doubt. I just watched. With me there watching, I knew my son wasn’t in any real danger, but I observed to see who was paying attention. As time went on, it became clear that my four-year-old son was really out there all on his own.</p>\n<p>No one was paying any attention to him for at least the 5 minutes I was observing, long enough for something to go horribly wrong. I watched long enough for me to have seen my 4-year-old son struggle to get out of the way of other kids much older and larger than him, playing and jumping off the floating dock in his vicinity. Some kids were jumping right over his head, and he showed signs of struggling to stay above water. It was at this point that I called to him to shore, my brother still out of view on the other side of the floating dock.</p>\n<p>Once back to shore, I kept my cool and didn’t yell, but I told my brother in a bit of an upset tone that my son shouldn’t have been that far out, and that he definitely shouldn’t be left unattended like that. He quickly got offended by this, arguing that my son wasn’t unattended. He acted as if it would’ve been impossible for anything to happen to him while wearing a life jacket.</p>\n<p>I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing. The icing on the cake was when my brother said something along the lines of “you’re welcome for entertaining your kid for the last couple of hours.” This just left me feeling very hot given that I had just spent 5 hours with his son without my brother the day prior, like he was doing me some enormous favor by spending an hour with my son, his nephew. I know he was just deflecting the fact that he failed to provide the most basic level of care and oversight to my son. </p>\n<p>I was upset at him, but more than anything, I was upset with my dad for his negligence. Later, my brother told me that my dad didn’t even tell him that he was leaving. I was flabbergasted. My dad’s brother died by drowning at the age of 18, so this fact surprised me even more.</p>\n<p>To top things off, my parents sided with my brother, and my dad basically denied any wrongdoing. My mom has always been protective of my youngest brother, but this was just over the top. She blamed me for stirring up things unnecessarily. </p>\n<p>I went over the situation again and again in my head to analyze whether I had done something wrong or if I had overreacted. I felt like I was being gaslighted. I wanted to leave, but I was trapped because I was far out in the country and didn’t have a car. And to make matters worse, my dad’s 60th birthday party was to be the next day, the entire purpose for the trip. </p>\n<p>Thank God nothing happened to my son, but I kept coming back to those first few moments when I saw him out there in the water alone. My stomach turns at the thought. But to be made to doubt the own validity of my feelings instead of acknowledging a mistake and just apologizing? I’m not exaggerating when I say that this experience had me looking back and questioning my own upbringing. </p>\n<p>It all left me feeling completely disappointed and disrespected by people I thought had more common sense than this, people whom I thought I could trust. I am still working through a lot of feelings about it.</p>\n<p>I spent the evening and much of the rest of the next day removing myself from the situation, staying in another camper. The following evening, I smoothed things over with my brother for the good of the order. It felt like I was lying to myself in doing so, but I didn’t want to ruin my dad’s big event. I’m still feeling deeply hurt by what went down and I’m having trouble trying to figure out how I can move forward given that it’s gone completely unacknowledged since. </p>\n<p>I left Michigan still pretty salty, but was trying to forget about it, focus on the positive, and look forward to a camping trip I had planned on the Oregon coast the following week—this past weekend. I booked the trip six <em>months</em> ago because state parks open up their registration that far in advance and the good places fill up pretty much instantly out here in Oregon (maybe it’s the same elsewhere, too). I knew the trip would be difficult with a young family, but I really thought we would have a lot of fun, too. Turns out we were not ready for that kind of trip. </p>\n<p>After days of preparation and loading the van to the roof liner, it was five hours by car until we reached our destination. My first mistake. My one-year-old daughter screamed and cried for at least half of that trip downstate, likely setting some kind of record, but also laying the groundwork for a pretty rough trip.</p>\n<p>Both kids thankfully fell asleep right before we got there, which allowed me and my wife to setup camp fairly quickly and undisturbed. We thought we had gotten over the hump, that we could just enjoy our time there, but unfortunately we were wrong.</p>\n<p>The coast ended up being pretty cold at night, dropping down into the upper 40s and low 50s, but it was the 35 mph wind gusts that really did us in. My wife, who had on several layers of clothes, a sleeping bag, and blankets, couldn’t handle the cold. Then, my daughter kept waking up periodically throughout the night before waking up permanently at between 4 and 5 a.m. each morning. As a result, we were all pretty miserable the entire time despite being in such a beautiful place. After two nights of that, we promptly packed up the van and checked ourselves into the nearest Best Western. </p>\n<p>For the most part, that went a lot better, albeit with an underlying air of defeat that permeated everything we did the remainder of the trip. Still, $500 later, we had a pool, a hot tub, and a couple warm beds to sleep in. But that wasn’t the end of it.</p>\n<p>Everywhere we went, the kid (my daughter) screamed. Hour trip up the 101 for a hike? Screaming child. Trying to grab some grub at a local brewery with great food and beer? Fussy, crying, screaming child. Spending time at the beach? Screaming child. I think she had just had enough of the road trip life. We all did. I lost my cool at one point and raised my voice, which I regret, feeling completely wiped myself. Most ironically, my son had a great time through all of it and didn’t want it to end. But for me, these experiences have made me want to stay home for the next couple of <em>years</em>.</p>\n<p>I would sometimes think how great it was that I had the opportunity to really plan for my family. That unlike my mom, who was thrust into motherhood as a teenager, I started a family in my late 30s because I had lived so much, settled into my career, and was so financially stable. But then other times, I am just so completely drained that I think I must have been crazy to think this would be easier.</p>\n<p>At any rate, the month of July can go to hell. I will remain within a 15 mile radius for the foreseeable future. I love my family and I love my life, but this summer is testing me. Until next time. </p>\n<p>Love, Dad</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I bought my house in 2016 before I was married or had kids. Coming from the Midwest, housing prices were pretty crazy out here in the Portland region. Not like the Bay Area by any means, but I only had my own income. I was pre-qualified for a mortgage based on my Midwest salary the year prior. I had very limited options, so I bought a short sale fixer upper. </p>\n<p>When I moved in, the place was in really rough shape. It had been a rental and I'm told that the last renters had multiple animals, including a potbelly pig. I keep a copy of my inspection report, not only as a list of things that need to be done, but as a reminder of how far it’s come. I’ve done most of the work myself, something I’m pretty proud of considering most of our neighbors even hire out their yard work. Blame it on my blue collar Midwestern upbringing. I’ve invested a lot of sweat into the thing. I have an emotional attachment to the place. </p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, there’s still a lot to do. It’s still got some pretty ugly laminate flooring downstairs and an old, dated kitchen from the 80s. And there are a few partially completed projects around the house. Those don't bother me too much, although I'm certain my wife might have something to say about that (she says we're not buying another house that isn't \"done\" -- I don't have the heart to tell her that it's not ever \"done\"). </p>\n<p>What bothers me is that it can feel like the walls are closing in on me now that we’re a family of four. Our house is 1300 square feet and it feels like we’re always right on top of one another. But for us to move into a larger house, we’d be looking at tripling our house payment.</p>\n<p>The plus side of this is that our housing costs are very low. Most of the houses like ours are selling for about double what we paid. Our monthly housing costs are one-half to one-third of what many of our friends pay. For now, this is suiting us fine, especially considering that we have two children in daycare that costs us a couple thousand dollars per month</p>\n<p>Some other financial positives are that, as a result of keeping our housing costs low, we’re able to save 20% for retirement and also put away a few hundred dollars per month for the kids’ college funds. We don’t have a lot left over at the end of the month, but we have an emergency fund that we almost never have to touch and don’t have to budget every penny we have. </p>\n<p>We don’t have any pressure to move except for our own desires. I’m trying hard to ignore my feelings, but I think social media hasn’t helped (one more reason to perhaps get off it). Since I come from a place where housing prices are way less, I get so see a lot of people back home posting photos of living in beautiful houses. I’m trying very hard to ignore my own jealous feelings and to deny my very American drive toward “more, more, more”, but on the other hand, why should it be so tough when we are considered upper middle class? I know we have so much more than most. I am grateful for what we have. Still, our homes are more than just backdrops, they frame so much of our daily lives. I am still trying to sort my feelings out on this stuff.</p>\n",

I unfortunately got behind on some monotonous tasks while we were out of the office due to Covid, so I’ve been playing catchup with filing and such. I’m also managing a project that is transitioning a very offline bureaucratic process into an online format. It’s unfortunate that I won’t be able to test out the system in real life, but I feel good about leading this project and hopefully providing a good tool for whoever takes my job after I’m gone. </p>\n<p>I heard from my new boss today. He and the director would like to get coffee with me next week as an informal way to get to know each other better and talk more about the position. I’m looking forward to it, and excited but nervous about the new direction my career is taking. </p>\n",

I’m getting good sleep, waking up earlier, showing up in all aspects of my life. In a lot of ways, I feel on top of things, and have a lot that is going well for me. I think I’m a pretty good dad most days, I try to be a good husband, I’ve made a good home for my family, I’m making advances in my career. </p>\n<p>Still, I have lost a lot of myself since becoming a father a little over 4 years ago. My life is so focused on others that it’s hard to ignore that I often don’t recognize myself anymore, not just physically but also in spirit. I am no longer a naive young man with too much to say, I’m a middle aged guy unsure that he has anything to say at all.</p>\n<p>I know that this is just part of parenthood and that things will never be the same. I also know that I’m in the thickest, deepest part of these woods just given my two kids’ ages. I don’t take for granted that they will never be this age again. I really do try to pour myself into this life and enjoy it at the same time. I’m happy nearly every single day. I find moments of peace and pleasure in small things. I don’t wish this time away for anything.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I just wish we had a little more help. I just know that I need to block out more intentional time for myself. </p>\n",

It’s just that the time commitment involved in nurturing a passion is severely diminished. Work, commute, house, 5-month-old baby — it’s seems so cliche, but finding the time for yourself really is difficult. And when you try to fit it in with any level of regularity, something else usually suffers. But does it have to? </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’ve been playing guitar since I was 14 years old. I never took lessons, but when you’re alone or unemployed or broke or all of the above, you’ve got a lot of time on your hands to noodle around and nurture it. What I lacked in knowledge, I made up in pure creativity. I’m not saying I was some sort of guitar god - that would be douchy as hell. But I loved playing so much and it was an escape from sometimes difficult reality. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fast forward almost 25 years and I’ve been trying to get back into it. For too many years, my guitar collected dust. I’d pick it up now and again, and it was sort of like riding a bike. But there’s a big difference between taking a leisurely roll around the neighborhood and competing in a triathlon with it. Dedication, education, persistence, passion - you have to want it. And even then, when you’re a cyclist, rarely do people ask you to perform for them on the spot. There’s an implied prerequisite to share your passion with others through performance when it comes to music, even when you treat it as something personal. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Playing guitar for me still is a meditation, but it was more on the leisurely roll side of things. I had fun, sang some tunes around the house, and blacked out the work day stress or nonstop baby puke. However, I’d been feeling like my life was missing an opportunity for growth and to get me out of my shell. . </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I started taking lessons for the first time a couple of months ago. I wasn’t sure how I’d like it, but it’s been incredible. It’s every other week, so not a huge commitment, but I already find myself getting to a level I’ve never reached before. I’m still rusty as hell, but it’s nice to be challenged in a way that is not in the form of a traditional education, or work or family related. It also gives me some much needed time to myself. I missed that. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All these years I feel like I’ve been coloring with 3 crayons. Learning the fretboard and scales (however slowly) is opening the palette up and making the creative process easier. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I’ve also made a friend in the neighborhood and we’re getting together for the first time tomorrow night to play acoustic guitar. I haven’t had a friend to play music with regularly in years and I’m actually pretty excited about it. I’m even more excited to have someone in my neighborhood instead of making the trek into Portland all the time. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At any rate, my goal by taking lessons and playing with others is to get better at improvisation and to become a better music writer. I harbor no illusions (or desires) to play regular gigs or becoming known in any way. But I would like to finally start making and recording music and honoring that part of myself that I’ve neglected as other parts of me grew. I’m setting that intention now and I’ll revisit this post in the coming years to see how I’ve done. Who knows, maybe I’ll even post something here someday. </p>\n</div>\n",

As expected, it’s been a busy and amazing time. My life is changed forever and in all the best ways. Life is more inwardly focused with less a feeling of rudderlessness. It’s simultaneously simpler yet more complicated. </p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For me and many others, the idea of parenthood before becoming a parent is often shrouded in in fear. Fear that a part of your life will come to an end because of the responsibilities and time commitments that come with becoming a parent. But then you become a parent and, for me, the perspective completely flips.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If I had to pick one word that best describes the human experience, it would be <em>adaptation</em>. To me it’s the human condition. Our greatest strength and our greatest source of suffering. </p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All the brilliant works of art and feats of engineering were the result of the incomparable human ability to adapt. And yet that feeling of dullness that can often take over our once novel feelings about some aspect of life is also caused by adaptation. Boredom is adaptation. Depression can be a symptom of adaptation.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We can desire change in our lives and seek it out, through hard work and focus. We can be driven toward a goal by passion. And it’s an awesome thing to achieve something you’ve set out to do. Sometimes change is thrust upon us and the pangs of anxiety can be so overwhelming that you feel as though you’re 100 feet underwater and can’t breathe. But all our new experiences become the new normal in time. </p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I guess what I’m trying to say is that, as an idea and a mindset, parenthood is my new normal. I am no longer fearful of the idea or the reality of parenthood. But the beautiful thing so far is that with every passing day, it’s different. My son changes every day, in big and small ways, and I get to help grow him into a person while simultaneously being filled with purpose.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are tough times, and there will be so many more. But they pale in comparison to the good. </p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And unlike the sometimes unhealthy human need for change for the sake of itself, having <em>this</em> purpose nourishes my human need to move forward and adapt without—pardon the expression—throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There are so many things I could have said in this first post as a parent, but it is just <em>too</em> <em>big</em> now. All I can say is that having my son has been an enormously additive experience to life and I just can’t imagine having never experienced it. </p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Love,</p><p style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Dad</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"></p>\n</div>\n",

I’ve never experienced anything like it and I just might have to do it a couple times a year for relaxation. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2225px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:133.3483123779297%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \"\n              >\n                \n                  <noscript><img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/ccb5a33aff.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5292.jpg\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/ccb5a33aff.jpg\" data-image=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/ccb5a33aff.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2225x2967\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"IMG_5292.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c468d89c2241ba6b9538717\" data-type=\"image\" />\n                \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:75%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \"\n              >\n                \n                  <noscript><img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/4a08c32584.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5286.jpg\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/4a08c32584.jpg\" data-image=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/4a08c32584.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"IMG_5286.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c468d09b914435393c3af7f\" data-type=\"image\" />\n                \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We rented a movie (Venom) and then went out to Breakside Brewing in Northeast for our friend Laura’s 30th birthday.

My brothers and I grew up poor but adjacent to wealthier people. We didn't go without, but I was consistently surrounded by kids who had everything they wanted and more.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">For the first part of my childhood, I also grew up without a father around. I think this contributed to my lack of confidence and knowledge about masculine things. I grew up knowing almost nothing about sports or cars or other things many men use to connect.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">To top it off, I have always been really quiet. This made me a target for bullying from the loud and more confident kids. My quietness and lack of confidence in myself made me not cool in the eyes of the ones I thought I wanted to be like.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Sadly, I think I internalized this feeling of being an outsider and channeled in negative ways. Some positive things too, like introspective hobbies like music and writing, but also negative habits like consistently comparing myself, what I have, what I have accomplished, and my tastes, to others. And although I’m aware of it and want to change it, I haven’t yet. I’m beginning to, but I haven’t gotten over the hump.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I find myself ever striving for more and focusing on material things. Not luxury cars, but quality things around the house. I get down on myself about the way my house looks and want to spend money to improve it (I bought it as a fixer up in the white hot Portland market back in 2016). I compare my neighborhood to others’. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But I think I‘m starting to feel more of a letting go of these feelings and fake needs as I get older. I find myself not interested in a lot fo the things I used to be interested in even a few years ago, favoring time spent in at night enjoying quiet introverted things like playing music or reading articles on the internet on random topics I’m interested in.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’m accepting myself more for who I am and what my strengths are versus a superficial quality of coolness or acceptance by others. And it’s pretty freeing. I am actually growing less and less interested in people in general, with the exception of those closest to me, and it feels great. Strange, perhaps. But I don’t feel anything unhealthy about it. I feel like my season of life is changing and that I’m <em>actually</em> ok with things slowing down to more of an internal focus. I’m focusing less on accomplishments and ownership and more on an internal exploration of my purpose in life.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I may not know who the cool bands are anymore and I still might not be able to chat up the boss about sports. I might be looked over for that promotion. But I’m becoming perfectly content with my quiet little life and worrying less and less about measuring it against those of others. &nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

So maybe I’ve been over thinking them and I should just keep them simple. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We are now less than 2 weeks out from our baby’s due date. In the last couple of weeks, we’ve had two sets of friends have their babies and that has helped to make things more real. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I mean, it’s really just a construct for us guys until the little person is out anyway, right? We’re not the ones going through all of it. We’re not feeling it inside ourselves. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And I guess the thing that is smacking me in the face is that this little human will be half of me. That is so banal that I almost passed out from boredom typing it. But that is really what I am gobsmacked about. That a person whom I love very much who is sitting in the other room is carrying a living being that is half me and half her. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This probably happens to everybody, but maybe I’m feeling it amplified because it’s been so difficult in seeing my own father in me given that he wasn’t in my life. It’s as though I’ve viewed myself as the child of my mother via asexual reproduction. Any lack of resemblance was merely a mutation or due to some environmental factor. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So today when I got home from work I found Shar lying on the bed in our room, exhausted from the day. She’s been a real trouper, working up until her due date and taking barre classes and such. So I crawl into bed with her and start rubbing her belly and I can feel this child’s outline. I can feel its bottom and along the side of its leg. I mean, it’s not too distinct, but you can sort of tell that this isn’t just a belly with a weird notch in it. And I’m just sitting in the relative quiet that is my life, the relative lack of responsibility for anything more than our dog, and realize. I just realize the reality. It’s slowly been creeping up on me, but it’s gonna hit me so hard when the little he or she is actually here.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I know, it’s dumb. But that’s how I feel right now. Dumb. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The other thing that has been sitting in the back of my mind is the hope that I’m not a failure. Throughout this pregnancy, everybody offers unsolicited advice. I know most mean well, but it can really shake you up if you let it. And it got me thinking about what if I’m not a great parent? All my life I’ve thought about how my father wasn’t there for me and that I’d be this wonderful father in spite of that. But what if I’m NOT? I know my shortcomings in life and I know the dreams I have in my head that I sometimes accomplish and sometimes don’t. I think of the goals I have and the ones I’ve gone after and the ones that collect dust. I guess I just hope I can provide the type of environment that my child or children can thrive. And that they not only love me but they like me and are proud of me someday. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’m also thinking about my own life and my own risks in different ways. I’m thinking about safety and security and looking both ways when I cross through a busy intersection. I peed at the urinal today and thought about saving for the future and life insurance and college. There’s been a lot of thoughts in this head. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The past few weekends, Shar and I have been sort of go-go-go. I felt a bit of panic that the house wasn’t looking that great and that we don’t have as much as so-and-so or that our house isn’t as nice as this-and-that. And in my way of anxiety, I took it out on Shar. I tend to compare and I really am trying to work on that, but there was no excuse to act mean to her especially at this time. We got through it, but I need to recognize that I need to recognize my feelings for what they are, accept them, and either do something to change it myself or express them and ask for help. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And it was so silly. About making our house a home and just wanting more help in making it look like a home. In the same ways Shar needs help around the house with logistical things. I guess I focus more on the art of it while she’s more practical in a lot of ways. I think we’ll rub off on each other through time.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Finally, I know my time is about to be eaten up to a great degree. I’m taking a month off when the baby is born and I’m so grateful I get to do that, but I know once they’re here that some things will be put on pause. Perhaps this writing, perhaps my playing music almost every night. Maybe our lazy nights on the couch. I guess I can’t really fathom how it’s going to be at the moment. Hell, the next time I write, I could very well have a baby and 2019 is halfway done. But  I hope I can retain a bit of myself along the way. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This feels like it’s been one big ramble, but I’m just so filled with a deep well of love and gratitude that I’m here right now and able to experience this. At least until I’m running on no sleep and elbow deep in shitty diapers. Until next time. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:75%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \"\n              >\n                \n                  <noscript><img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/625bd7b242.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_5203.jpg\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/625bd7b242.jpg\" data-image=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/625bd7b242.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x1875\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"IMG_5203.jpg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c3ed0a788251b627b9f7788\" data-type=\"image\" />\n                \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n",

We leaned over and kissed each other at midnight, turned off the light, and fell asleep. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I also woke up sober and feeling alive. My skin had color to it and I smiled a lot, perhaps for the first since legally able to drink. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I ran 3 day this week. Yesterday I did 3 miles and ran a personal record at age 37, which is still a depressingly slow 10 minute something split. However, I’m trending in the right direction. I took today off because I sort of hurt my leg yesterday and wanted to give it a day to rest. Plus, I really don’t think the running 5 days a week thing is good for our joints. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I have still not lost any weight despite burning about 500 extra calories per day and giving up a lot of not-so-great foods. Not sure what is up there but I can only think it’s at least partially attributed to the vegetarian diet. I see folks doing keto losing tons of weight and it’s sort of frustrating given what I thought I was doing when I began this journey. At least I’m still not gaining. But I might have to rethink this thing. I’m working on 11 months without a piece of animal flesh in my digestive system and I’m rather enjoying it, but I’d really love to lose about 30 pounds. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">My last update was about wearing the holter monitor after 3 months of trying to get one from Kaiser Permanente. They shaved my chest and glued the thing on. I dropped it off on New Year’s Day. Still no word. I’m coming to expect this. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The baby’s due two weeks from Saturday. I keep thinking I’m gonna get an excited call from Shar telling me things are happening. I don’t think she’s ever been more ready to be a mother in her life. Me, I’m a little nervous but also very excited. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Two nights ago it moved a lot in her belly and I caught a little bit of it on video. Kind of alien-like! Can’t wait to meet him or her!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:133.3199920654297%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \"\n              >\n                \n                  <noscript><img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/1721ca8310.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4855.jpeg\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/1721ca8310.jpg\" data-image=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/1721ca8310.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3333\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"IMG_4855.jpeg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c37eb0eb8a045dca94ffd4d\" data-type=\"image\" />\n                \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I finally complained to Kaiser Permanente that I was going to switch insurance providers if they didn’t get me in for a holter moniter. It had been three months since my doctor requested one for me and I was getting pretty upset. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thursday KP called me to setup an appointment for the next day to get fitted for one. The lady was apologetic, and I kept my cool, but I really wanted to be an asshole. Even if this turns out to be nothing, no one should have to wait 3 months for something so simple when you have a family history of heart problems. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, my heart has only done its flutter twice since I’ve been wearing this thing, so hopefully they can get a read on it and tell me what’s going on. I’m wearing it it until 4:00 today. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My grandfather, whom I met only once, had a condition called an bicuspid aortic valve and died in his 60s. I learned this from my half uncle, whom also has the condition and had heart surgery in his 40s. I may not have it. My recent EKG came back normal, but they only monitored for about a minute. This bicuspid aortic valve is like a an occasional hard push in the heart. I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is the same thing. But the combo had me scared and wanting to know. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Prior to figuring out my family history, I thought maybe it had something to do with my smoking or eating too much shit food. But I just hit the two year mark since I last had a cigarette and I’m working on a year since I’ve had meat. My cholesterol was way down 6 months after quitting the stuff. And I kept having the heart flutter. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Maybe this isn’t a big deal. But I guess I know my body and it’s not something I’m used to experiencing. Things happen as we age, but it still seems strange. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In other news, Melissa started having contractions for her baby yesterday and she’s in the hospital. I guess after hours she is still being induced. I’m not sure of the details, but I hope all is well with her and her son. I’m sure we’ll learn more soon enough from her and Natasha. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I drove to work yesterday for the first time in a couple of months since I needed to go to the hospital yesterday. I went to Ross and got some new underwear, which I’m strangely excited about. I also think driving sucks now. Traffic was super frustrating on lunch and after work and I can tell it has a major impact on my mental attitude. Even though I got my car fixed, I’m still taking the train to work (I did every day but Friday this week). </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The weather has been consistently a little more wet, but not terrible for this time of year. The cloud breaks are still common, we haven’t got any snow, and we only had a couple of days of frost. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Zoey is sitting on the bed behind me and has brought multiple toys to me to get my attention.

I am probably the most nostalgic person I’ve ever known in real life and letting go of that is pretty tough. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’ll get lost in old notebooks or saved greeting cards for hours. I often think about people from my past. I think about my successes and my mistakes, of which there are many of both. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But the older I get, the more respect I have for myself, too. I have higher expectations of the company I choose to keep because I ain’t got the time or the energy for anything else. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">My Instagram feed will not be filled with photos of me in large groups of people in interesting social situations. No, I have few friends, but the ones I keep around I truly value and I think they value me. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’ve got a quirky personality, I am often quiet, and I can be awkward. A lot of people don’t know how to work with that or accept that. But the people I keep around work through that and allow me to be me, and that has become center stage in my awareness of good people. They stick out like sore thumbs, the ones who try and listen and smile and ask questions. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I don’t have the time or the space for superficial interactions, for political drama or thinly veiled insecurities on social media, for people who chatter. I’ve found the down-to-earth people, the lovers, the encouragers, the listeners, and I ain’t got no time for the holier-than-thou’s. And damn if it doesn’t feel good to respect myself enough to make  space for the real ones.</p>\n</div>\n",

Christmases were always such a big deal in our house. Tree, decorations, lots of gifts. My mom still tries to buy us all a bunch of gifts and I’m pushing 40. But with the baby coming next month, budgeting takes precedence. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And to be honest, Shar and I had some disagreements over this. I am definitely less frugal than her, and I got upset. No one ever said marriage was easy, and compromise we sometimes do. I’m working on it. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I grew up living at my grandmother’s house for a number of years. It was a tiny little 3-bedroom place in Saginaw, Michigan. I had 6 aunts and uncles and a lot of them had kids as well and we’d all cram into that house and the presents would be stacked halfway to the ceiling it seemed. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">My grandmother, who lived on social security only, would save up for half the year just to make sure each of her dozen or so grandkids would have something from her to open on Christmas morning. She had a budget of $25 or so for each kid. I know that was a lot of money for her, but it was important to her. I think that must have stuck with me because I still view Christmas as a really big deal, even when money is tight. Not in the sense that I think mindless consumerism is important. But just that it’s the time to splurge a little and show the people you love that you’ve been thinking of them.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Here in Oregon, it’s still a little strange adjusting to the moderate temps and general lack of snow in these parts of the world this time of year. At that same grandma’s house, she used to cover her crappy windows in clear plastic to keep the chill out of the rooms. I can still remember her standing on a chair and using a blow dryer to heat and stretch the plastic until it fit snugly. I’d often wake up as a kid and sit over a heater vent on the ground, pulling my shirt over my knees and trapping all the heat into it. But I ain’t complainin’ about the weather in the PNW. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">This year, we spent Christmas Eve in La Center with Shar’s mom and step family. Big full house with lots of kids. It was fun.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">After opening up gifts for our own wee little Christmas yesterday, Shar and I went up to Hagg Lake and walked a trail. Zoey stomped around in the mud a bit yesterday and we could tell she had a really good time running around and sniffing everything that she could. She snagged a few dozen burs in her Velcro fur and got mud all over. A glob of mud got on her eyelash and basically cemented it shut. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">At one point, Zoey jumped a small creek to retrieve a stick (we threw over) and she had a hard time convincing herself that she could get back to us. It was kind of cute as she whined like a puppy, but we eventually got her back. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Back at the house, the dog got a bath and some scissors to the fir. I fiddled with the washing machine that has been giving us problems and Shar whipped up a real nice Christmas dinner (I’m looking forward to the leftovers for lunch today). After dinner, we all snuggled up on the couch and rented a movie before calling it a night. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Today I celebrate 2 years since I had my last cigarette. I remember smoking my last one the day after Christmas in 2016 and hopping a plane back to Portland before we went off to San Diego for New Years’ Eve. I was so tired of the control it had over me. It goes without saying, but this was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. To say nothing about the health benefits, I’m saving at least $2500 per year. Can’t believe how much went up in smoke over the years, but happy to report I’m still going strong and not looking back. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"></p>\n</div>\n",

As we all shuffled out of the train and onto shuttles, I was annoyed. I’ve been riding the train for a few months now and I was going to be late for work again because of it.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">As we departed by bus, I fired up Twitter for the scoop. It turns out that a train hit a pedestrian and they were avoiding Quatama while police investigated the incident.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Someone lost their life too soon today. And their loved ones are grieving the loss with some immense amount of pain that lacks any meaning. And somewhere a train operator killed someone and is likely dealing with their own pain and grief.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So even though I was 45 minutes late for work, it doesn’t mean anything. It’s not worth it to hold a negative thought. Hug your loved ones and live your life with happiness in your heart.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">In some positive news, my mom finished her last round of chemo today after starting a few months ago after her  double mastectomy. I know it’s been scary for her, and I’m glad she’ll be on the mend now. It was scary for us all, and we’re all thankful for her catching it early and for the good prognosis. </p>\n</div>\n",

Not a place setup for vegetarians and sharing, so I was sort of disappointed, but I got something I could eat, ate some cheese, bread, and a beat salad, and a little bit of dessert. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The night was going well, but the girls and their mom got into a bit of an argument at the end, so things got tense there for a minute. Shar’s sister is in town form San Diego so I don’t think it was her idea of a good use of her time. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">They dropped me off at the train at Goode Hollow so I could high-tail it home. They argued more on their way back to the in laws’ house, but I guess they all smoothed it over today. Something about past relationships, too much drink in the system, etc. Something something about our baby-to-be. I don’t really care, just glad it’s all back to normal. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So I had the house to myself and honestly I fell asleep really early (for me, that’s 10:00). I slept on my back wrong at the in laws’ and I needed to just not think about the pain and not move. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Went to the gym today on lunch. Didn’t eat much, so I swung by a Lebanese place at the Orenco stop on the way home. First time there. Not too bad. Saved enough of my falafel wrap for lunch tomorrow.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">On my way back to the train, I saw that a new brewery is opening up called Manama Brewing Co. I guess they’re out of Corvallis, and I’m super excited that they’ll be there even though I know nothing about them. </p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    <div\n        class=\"\n          image-block-outer-wrapper\n          layout-caption-below\n          design-layout-inline\n          combination-animation-none\n          individual-animation-none\n          individual-text-animation-none\n        \"\n        data-test=\"image-block-inline-outer-wrapper\"\n    >\n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure\n            class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \"\n            style=\"max-width:2500px;\"\n        >\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          <div\n              \n              \n              class=\"image-block-wrapper\"\n              data-animation-role=\"image\"\n              \n  \n\n          >\n            <div class=\"sqs-image-shape-container-element\n              \n          \n        \n              has-aspect-ratio\n            \" style=\"\n                position: relative;\n                \n                  padding-bottom:133.3199920654297%;\n                \n                overflow: hidden;-webkit-mask-image: -webkit-radial-gradient(white, black);\n              \"\n              >\n                \n                  <noscript><img src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/fd00c2327e.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_4373.jpeg\" /></noscript><img class=\"thumb-image\" src=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/fd00c2327e.jpg\" data-image=\"https://indw.blog/uploads/2023/fd00c2327e.jpg\" data-image-dimensions=\"2500x3333\" data-image-focal-point=\"0.5,0.5\" alt=\"IMG_4373.jpeg\" data-load=\"false\" data-image-id=\"5c0f25520ebbe834a5e5c572\" data-type=\"image\" />\n                \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    </div>\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">We don’t have anything of the sort within easy reach of the house, at least not by transit, so this is much needed.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I did 5 miles today on my lunch hour. I can tell I’m going to hurt a bit tomorrow, but hell if it didn’t feel great! I am debating if I should get up early tomorrow and ride the opposite direction of my meeting in Portland to do my weight day. It will make for a long one, but I hate it that I’d otherwise have to miss. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Anyway, Shar and I had a bit of a discussion about my airline miles credit card. I paid for my flight (Thanksgiving week no less) with my Delta card because I had accumulated 70,000 miles. Sort of stupid since I was saving up for a trip to Europe, but with the baby coming along, I really didn’t want to spend $700 on a flight to Michigan in November. Anyway, that’s besides the point. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The reason I had 70,000 miles on my credit card is because I spent $70,000 on my credit card. That alone should give me pause. Sure, it was over the course of a year and a half, but still. I pay it off every month, but it’s one of those things where I didn’t really think too much about whether or not I had the money to spend because it wasn’t coming out of my checking account right at that moment. So, I spent more than I should have, consistently. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So I’ve switched over to using my debit card, which in and of itself is enough to curb the spending. When you see your checking account balance, the internal debate is a lot stronger as to whether or not you need a specific item. Most often, the answer is ‘no’. Anyway, I think I’m reigning it in and the spending habit is being curbed. Besides, if you just saved the annual fee you spend on those things, you’re halfway to a ticket right there.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And traveling is something we want to do. Where, no one knows. Neither of us have traveled with a baby before, so that will be freaky. But I know we both need it. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">As for work, things are going fine. I just passed my 1 year anniversary in the new role and I couldn’t be happier with the change. It’s sort of strange being slightly lower on the totem pole, but sometimes you have to take a step back to move ahead, and my happiness and fulfillment are pretty high even if I’m not getting rich anytime soon. Of course the benefits don’t hurt - we did the math the other day and it’s going to cost about $600 out-of-pocket to have the baby. Not too shabby if you ask me. Things are cruising. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The interesting and difficult thing will be doing the math early next year. I think a lot of people are going to be shocked when they do their taxes with the changes made to the tax code since Trump took office. Let’s just say I hope you increased your withholdings if you’re the type of person who likes to get money back. Your vacation may be a staycation. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And since it will be the first year Shar and I can choose to do our taxes jointly or apart, that adds another element of difficult. Mostly because both of our student loan payments are based on income. So if we file together, our income is higher, and our payments could potentially go up. We’re both on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) train and I’m about halfway done with it before the remainder is forgiven. In this situation you want to pay as little as possible. So we may file separately despite the implications for our taxes. I may post a spreadsheet here once I get it figured out just in case anyone else is in a similar boat. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">At any rate, I’ve got the house to myself tonight so it’s time to go hit some strings on my guitar. Nighty night. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">As I mentioned briefly in a previous post, I’ve been going to the gym every day on my lunch hour. With the exception of Thanksgiving week when I went to Michigan to visit family, I’d say I’ve been going every day for at least 7 weeks, with a week or two before that when I went 3 days a week. A couple months doesn’t sound like much—and really, it isn’t—but I feel like I’ve built a habit and now I can’t wait to go to the gym. I never thought it’d be me. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Although I haven’t seen any change at all in my weight, I’m feeling a lot different and my body feels leaner and more tone.  I feel like my muscles work now, and every movement I make becomes more apparent. I can feel my core and my thighs and my arm muscles and it gives me more confidence. Sometimes even the slight pain caused by a good weight session feels good. Honestly thought, I don’t hurt a whole lot. I’m wondering if it has something to do with my vegetarian diet. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I began with 3 days of cardio and 2 days of weights, but with all of the reading I’ve been doing, it sounds like weight training might be where it’s at. Now I do weight training 3 days a week and 2 days of cardio. So if I get any excercise at all on the weekend, like with a walk or a hike, I’m getting three of each. It’s a lot more likely I’m going to get in a passive cardio day on the weekend anyway. Walking to the train everyday helps me get in some steps as well. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I started with really intense cardio sessions. Like trying to run long distances on the treadmill. But after reading a book by Rich Roll, an Ultra Man, I’ve switched to heart rate targeting for weight loss, even if that means quickly walking for an hour. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’m taking it easy on the weights, for the most part. It’s been over a decade since I’ve done any sort of weight training and the last thing I want to do is injure myself and set myself back. But I think I’m getting to the point where I don’t feel like a total weakling and I can start lifting heavier. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">As I said earlier, my body rarely hurts anymore from lifting with the exception of squats. Before this month, I don’t recall ever doing a squat in my life. I have some chicken ass legs and I’d like to change that, especially after injuring my quads in winter kickball the last 2 years straight. I figure it’s time to get these things into shape. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’m gradually seeing my body change, but the quickest changes have been in my attitude and mental health. Honestly, I’m just a whole lot more happy. Every day I just feel happy and peaceful. I sleep better. I’m more content. It’s like all of those years as a hyper-caffeinated smoker with anxiety are washing away. Those days where I felt like a worthless punk with no motivation - I can see those attributes slipping away. And I like the way it feels. </p>\n</div>\n",

It seems like the go-go-go sometimes needs a break, and that’s what we did. At least in the sense that we weren’t off to somewhere or something for a change.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I cleaned out my closet. Yep, dug down to the bottom of things. All of the stuff that doesn’t make me feel great to wear, or my belly has outgrown them. Lots of 34 size pants. A few medium shirts. We filled up a donation basket and brought it to the second hand store.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">For the last several years, I’ve had a bit of a heart…flutter. It’s not a painful thing and it’s completely sporadic. I thought maybe it had something to do with smoking or perhaps how much meat I was eating. Maybe it had something to do with my sleep apnea. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But I quit smoking a couple years ago. I don’t eat meat anymore. I wear my CPAP machine every night. And my heart still does this weird skip-a-beat thing maybe 10 or 12 times a day. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">About a year ago, I connected online with a half uncle whom I’ve never met. Long story, but my paternal grandfather and grandmother divorced, my grandfather moved to Florida, and started another family. Well, over the course of our email conversations, I found out that both my uncle and my grandfather have had heart attacks and open heart surgery to correct a genetic heart condition. This got me a bit worried. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So for the last several months I’ve been trying to get it checked out through Kaiser Permanente. My doctor ordered an EKG, which came back normal, and then asked if I'd like to have a 24-hour holter monitor. Indeed I did. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">But KP has been short staffed and evidently has no openings for appointments. It’s been months now. I emailed my doctor to ask if they could refer me out to someone not in their network, and he told me “no - this is not life threatening and it is extremely unlikely that I have a life-threatening condition.” Well, this doctor can kiss my ass. And so can KP. Here I am, before open enrollment for my insurance, and I want to switch so badly but can’t because my wife has been seeing the same medical team throughout her pregnancy and the baby is due next month. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I am just so flabbergasted that KP has been so amazing for my wife’s pregnancy, but absolutely dropped the ball through this seemingly simple - but important - thing for me. I want to get to the bottom of why my heart is doing this, and I think my family history backs up my rationale, particularly since my g-pa died in his 60s from a major heart attack. I wanted to like Kaiser, but I’ve just heard too many crazy stories to stick with them. Even if my heart is fine, I hate the not knowing, and I don’t think anyone should have to wait on something so important. </p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I made my last car payment this month. It’s hard to believe I’ve been making that $320 payment every month for 5 years. Hell, I can’t believe how much has changed in 5 years. But I won’t go there!</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I also got the private mortgage insurance removed from my house. I bought a short sale a couple years ago with very little money down. You need to have 20% down to not have private mortgage insurance, or 80% loan-to-value (LTV). So I had the bank do a broker’s price opinion. That came back $120,000 over what I owe, which is like 63% LTV. So we’re good. My payment went down by $100/mo. Thinking back to a few years ago living in Michigan, this would never have been possible. I bought at just about the highest point out here, but got lucky with a short sale fixer-upper near the MAX blue line. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I’ve also been taking the train to work. My yearly transit pass is paid for by my employer. I parked the car in the garage and haven’t moved it for over a month. I figure I’m saving about $100/mo on gas and I have no interest in going back to car commuting anytime soon. My stress level alone has dropped tremendously not having to fight traffic. Plus, it’s only a 20-minute ride. It was sort of stupid I held onto driving for so long - blame it on my Motor City area roots.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Since I don’t have my car at work, I’m not eating out for lunch as much because anywhere I eat I need to walk to. I’m bringing leftovers most days now. I’d say, sadly, I used to eat out 3-4 times per week. Now I do about once. I figure I’m saving at least $80/mo. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">However, I did join a gym and I’ve been going every day on my lunch hour. That’s $25. I have time to do this since I bring my own lunch most days. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So…I think I’m saving about $575 per month. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">If I removed collision insurance from my car and just got comprehensive, I’d probably be saving about $600/mo (that’s $7200/year). </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I mean, that’s like getting a 15% raise. Isn’t that crazy? I swear, car ownership and insurance are the biggest scams. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">I feel like a lot of people’s issues with money could be resolved by moving closer to a bus stop. </p>\n</div>\n",

'Can't help think that the pleasure's in the missing.” ― Eleanor Catton, \"The Luminaries\"  </p></blockquote><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Settling in back at home and at work after a week back in the mitten state. It’s getting stranger and stranger going back, if I’m being honest. It’s always good to see everybody and old haunts, but the longer I’m in Oregon the more Michigan’s problems become glaringly obvious. From roads that will shake your fillings out, to dying downtowns trying their damnedest to hold on, it’s rough to be there for any length of time. Hell, even the skies are a different sort of gray than Oregon’s, and that’s saying a lot. At least here the sky moves and swirls and lets the light through, its rains giving the trees life and keeping things emerald. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It was good to see my family. However, things haven’t been amazing for them. Eric lost his job at the dealership and Brad is going through a divorce. Mom had her double mastectomy a couple months ago and even though she’s handling her chemo really well, it’s still scary. She’s lost her hair, but she looks healthy, if not more tired than usual. The doctors seem very positive about her prognosis. I know they’ll all get through this. My dad is also retiring soon, so I’m excited to see how they get to enjoy that. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">It was great to see my nephew Lincoln, old friends, my Gran in Detroit. I visited my other grandmother’s grave and her old house where we used to live, in Saginaw. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">Back here, we’re cozied up for the holidays and sloshy weather, waiting for our baby to get here. Last night we had a birthing class, which was really eye-opening to me. Shar went last week with her mom since I wasn’t in town, but last night was my first class. The teacher is great. She was a doula for a lot of years and she’s a mother of 3, so she really knows her stuff and is giving us a lot of details on what to expect when Sharayah goes into labor. I’m feeling more confident about it already. I think Sharayah is, too. Two more months and everything will change. Something people can’t seem to stop reminding me about in their weird smugness like no one has ever gone through it but them. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">As for my health, I’m just a month away from not having had a cigarette in 2 years. I haven’t vaped in about 5 months. I’m about 9 months into vegetarianism. I’ve gained probably close to 10 pounds between the quitting smoking and quitting meat. My cholesterol is way down. I changed gyms, to one close to my work, so I can walk there on my lunch break. I’ve been going every day. It’s awesome. I’ve also been taking the train to work everyday, which gets me walking even more. So hopefully in a few months this can help me shed some of the pounds. Of all the things that have changed for the better, my weight has been one of the few things getting me down. But I will get it done, I will.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"></p>\n</div>\n",

I started this blog out of an excitement for living more intentionally, and as a result of living more intentionally, this blog fell to the wayside. I started a new job that I love, got married, went on a honeymoon, became a vegetarian (7 months!), quit using nicotine altogether (almost 2 years cigarette-free, 3 months vape-free!), and now my wife is 22 weeks pregnant with our first child. Whew.</p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">And yet life has not been all sunshine and butterflies. My mother was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. She’s about to start chemotherapy this week. It’s been difficult emotionally thinking about my mom as anything other than super human, but also just being far away and not able to be there for her in the ways I think I should has been difficult for me. My middle brother is also going through a divorce and navigating what that looks like with a 12-year-old daughter. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">About a month ago, I deleted my social media accounts that I thought were mostly just a waste of my time. I’d succumbed to participating in meaningless online political debates and probably lost some friends as a result. I also periodically fell for the trap of comparing my life to other people’s highlight reels. So I thought it was the healthy thing to do. </p><p style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">So I think, instead of trying to maintain this space as some sort of self-help style blog for others, I intend to refocus my energies on shorter thoughts that are more self-centered and focused on my own journey and growth as a human. Anyone who wants to peek in or pull up a seat, by all means  </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"></p><p data-rte-preserve-empty=\"true\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </p>\n</div>\n",

I don’t have a problem with sleeping, especially since getting a CPAP machine a few years ago for my sleep apnea. I usually sleep like a rock. But it’s the <em>falling</em> asleep that I’m not good at.</p><p>Not only am I easily distracted and have a tendency to try and get projects done late into the night, I’m also generally an anxious person and tend to ruminate a lot, especially about work. So I spend a lot of time on my iPad or iPhone as an easy distraction from where my mind might otherwise go.</p><p>Screen time is a major culprit of my sleep problems. I’ve switched to using ‘Night Mode’ on the iPhone and iPad, a feature that allows you to turn down the blue light that has been linked to keeping us from falling asleep, but it still keeps me awake. On the one hand, reading calms my worrying mind, but it also keeps my mind active when I should be trying to quiet it.</p><p>I had been passing out sometime between midnight and 1 a.m.  Then I’d wake up sometime between 6:30 and 7:00, scramble to get ready, and go about my day. It sets a bad stage for the day, and by the time I get home, I’m so completely spent that sometimes I can’t imagine doing much of anything. The lack of sleep also begets more worry about the things left undone, and the cycle continues.</p><p>It also affects my relationships in that when I don’t get enough sleep, I can be a real grump. Who wants to be around a crabby ass all the time? Not me. It was actually my partner who brought thisnto my attention — that not getting enough sleep also impacts her, and that is what ultimately made me realize I needed to make a change.</p><p>So I’m a little over a week into August and I’m already noticing a huge difference in my attitude, productivity, and attentiveness. I’ve been making it a point to try and not look at my phone past about 10:30, though I’d like to roll that back to an earlier point in the night. I’ve also been focusing on my breathing and practicing mindfulness just before sleep. It hasn’t been perfect, but I’ve definitely been falling asleep earlier more often than not, getting up earlier, and generally feeling happier. I’m also less anxious.</p><p>What’s more, I’m getting some things done in the mornings when I wasn’t before. In addition to  finishing little chores that I sometimes don’t like to do after work, I’m getting a little bit of exercise in. I actually went for a run this morning at 6 a.m., something I haven’t done in a very long time.</p><p>I’ve come to the conclusion that sometimes, when things feel a little off, it’s good to evaluate some of the simple things first. The way we eat, the amount of physical activity we get, and how much we’re sleeping. This all may seem obvious, but I didn’t realize just how much my lack of sleep had been affecting me lately.</p>\n</div>\n",

In fact, you don't even have to work any more than you already do. It's actually pretty simple. All you have to do is cancel your cell phone plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Hello? Are you still there?&nbsp;</p><p>OK, hear me out. You don't have to go completely off the grid to still save a load of cash.&nbsp;</p><p>You might already be on a budget friendly plan, but for the purposes of this example I'm using Verizon's Unlimited Plan.</p><p>Verizon, amid increasingly steep competition, started offering its unlimited plan for about $87/month if you already own your phone (a bit lower if you use a debit card) . As part of this new plan, they separated out the cost of their device subsidization so that you could have greater choice over what you want to pay for when it comes to devices. It was probably a calculated decision by Verizon thinking you'd upgrade more frequently, which would keep you tethered to their service. But it can work in your favor. Those device payments are pretty high, but if you already have a device that’s a couple years old, you’re likely already saving anywhere from $20-$40 per month.</p><p>This latter part is awesome because, for people who don't need a new device every year, you can save a pretty good chunk of change once your contract is up. I immediately started saving about $40/mo because my contract ended and I don’t have a need for the newest iPhone. But if you’re not on contract, you could be saving a lot more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I have a feeling that a lot of people are either out of contract already, or will be soon. That's because the new iPhone is about to debut in a few months and a lot of people tend to sign up for a new contract in September when the new iPhones come out. And although tempting, you may want to think twice about lining up for the iPhone X. That's because you'll be paying back your device for the next two years at a price that's likely about $40 per month.</p><p>The more drastic cost savings comes from canceling your cell service altogether. It may be a difficult decision, but it’s totally doable, especially if you have WiFi at home and at work. If you canceled your cell service, you could easily save over $1,000 per year. In fact, if you're currently paying one of the monthly device fees, your savings could be higher than $1,500 per year. That's not even counting what you could potentially save if you're on a family plan.</p><p>Got Comcast (shudder)? If you do, then you also have WiFi almost anywhere because they allow their customers to piggy back off the WiFi networks of any Comcast-served household. Presto: cell service. That means you could pretty easily go to a WiFi only phone situation with only minor inconvenience. Hey, it would still be downright remarkable compared to cell service and dumb phones just 10 years ago.</p><p>One thing that could make the transition easier is that Google still maintains a free service called Google Voice. It’s an app you can download that allows you to make voice calls, send texts, and receive voicemail over WiFi. You can use either the Google Voice or the Google Hangouts app for these services. And while you can get a new number from Google, you can also port over your current number to their system (careful - porting will cancel your current cell service if you’re not ready.)&nbsp; Other options include sending iMessages through your email address or making voice calls through Facebook Messenger.</p><p>Not ready to make such a leap? There are a lot of Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services out there like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ting.com/\">Ting</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://republicwireless.com/\">Republic Wireless</a> that only charge you for what you use. On Ting, for example, you can get 500 minutes and 1,000 texts for $20 per month if you only use data on WiFi. Hell, when’s the last time you actually used 500 minutes, anyway? Plus, with the GSM SIM card, you can still make calls over WiFi in the native phone app already on your device. That’s a savings of over $800 per year compared to the Verizon plan. That’s probably enough cash to pay for most of that trip you’ve been wanting to take for the last decade.</p><p>Now that music streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify allow you to download songs onto your device for playback offline, and Google Maps lets you download map regions for navigation, moving to WiFi-only data is easier than ever.</p><p>Having cell service everywhere without having to worry about data limits is awesome. But ultimately the choice to have it or go without is about our priorities. Personally, I'd rather save or spend that money on other things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

I really just wanted to try something new because I was in a rut, but decided if I were going to make a big move, I’d have to be very deliberate about it because I tend to make decisions with my heart and that usually ends up biting me in the ass.</p><p>I was as analytical as possible when I finally decided where I was going to focus my energies in terms of locations where I wanted to apply for jobs. Location was the single most important decision for me when deciding on a job. </p><p>First, I put together a spreadsheet of all the things I wanted out of a place. Job prospects, transit, live music, plenty of outdoor activities, weather, you name it. Whatever I valued, I included. I went to all kinds of lengths to find websites that ranked cities and regions by their various characteristics, and then I assigned my own point values. After that, I added up all the points for each place and ranked the cities. Then I applied to jobs in my top 5 places.</p><p>I landed in Portland just about 2 years ago and I feel like my analytical decision-making paid off. I have a decent job, I met my amazing fiancé Shar, and I bought a house. I’m lucky to have the ability to spend most of my free time doing things I love, such as going on hikes and spending time outdoors, exploring Portland and the pacific northwest, working on my fixer upper of a home, and seeing live music. But now my life season is changing again, and it’s time to recalibrate because I'm not just making decisions for myself anymore.</p><p>I bought a house while I was dating Shar and I made the decision based solely on my own lifestyle and what I valued. I wanted to be less reliant on my automobile, so I bought a house on the MAX light rail line dead center between my job and Portland. I didn’t want to have a long commute to work because that can be miserable, time-consuming, and expensive.</p><p>But now that I’m planning on spending my life with someone else and starting a family, my decisions don’t just impact me. My commute is a breeze, but I’m not married to my current work. However, it provides the majority of our income. Shar loves her job but she is about an hour away from her work, both ways in bad traffic. She also drives as part of her job, which doesn’t help things. She comes home satisfied with her work but exhausted because of the drive.</p><p>Therein lies the predicament. I’m big on living close to my work, but she wants to be closer to hers. Our current jobs don’t allow either of us to be close to work at the same time, so that means we have three choices. Maintain the current living arrangement, one of us get a new job, or move again. </p><p>We haven’t decided what we will do or what values are most important to us in the long run. Right now, there isn’t a win-win situation, and we both are making sacrifices.</p><p>Is having a more fulfilling but lower paying job more important than location? For Shar, the answer is yes, and for me the answer is no. At least for now, but maybe not forever.</p><p>As time goes on, we’ll have to make some tough choices and continue to work on aligning our lifestyle with our life goals. How do you and your partner make decisions on where you work and where you live? What has been most valuable to you?</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p>There are certainly far more important topics to cover than social media, but I’ve had some thoughts on this topic bottled up inside my brain for about a year now and I felt it was a good time to unburden myself of them. Our collective preoccupation with social media may seem pretty innocuous, if not wholly ridiculous, but I feel strongly that it can have some really negative consequences for both mental health and interpersonal relationships.</p><p>I’ve gone through periods of time when I get completely jaded with social media and I’ll temporarily deactivate or delete all of my accounts. Part of it is my frustration with my own addictive personality and how I can get so wrapped up in it, but I know I’m not alone in this.&nbsp;</p><p>It can be pretty freeing in some ways to completely ghost from your online life. Last year I deleted all of my social media accounts for six months. All of them. Even LinkedIn, for crying out loud. I was so committed! I was going to be present, dammit! And in a lot of ways, it was the happiest I’d been in a really long time. Correlation does not necessarily equal causation, but the evidence is pretty compelling that if we’re more present in our everyday lives, it pays dividends in the form of happiness and contentment.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the benefits: Freedom from prying eyes. Less opportunity for judgment. Freedom from bullying cleverly disguised as differences of opinion. Much less exposure to extremist politics or worrying about being politically correct. Fewer interruptions. More focus. Better in-person connections. Freedom from those phone notifications buzzing your thigh every thirty seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, it was fantastic. But leaving the online life behind wasn’t without its growing pains.&nbsp;</p><p>As weird as this feels to write publicly, there were some amazing moments and experiences I really wanted to share with the world. I had recently started dating my fiancé and it would’ve been a convenient way for far-flung friends and family to get to know her, if only in a virtual sense. But what I was least prepared for when I quit social media was how it can feel like some people stop caring about you. Scratch that. How it feels to seemingly cease to exist to people with whom you thought you had a stronger connection.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, just one month off Facebook and the only people who got ahold of me on my birthday were my Mom and my two brothers. No joke. It’s in those moments when you realize who the most important people are in your life, and there’s a pretty good chance they’re not the 200 people who wished you a happy birthday on your Facebook timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>But you know what? After the initial shock of being social media-less wore off, I was probably happier than I’d ever been. It was pretty amazing to actually feel like I was living in the moment—in all of the moments—and not constantly worrying about sharing with the world whatever thing I was doing at the time.</p><p>Recently I’ve been feeling the pull toward living without social media again. But one of the biggest deterrents to not going completely rogue is that I’ve got this blog now and it’s difficult enough as it is to get the word out. Hell, you can’t even have a Facebook page for your brand without an actual personal Facebook account. So there’s that.&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s also the 13 years of status updates and photos and memories that I’d rather not have weighing me down anymore. I’d rather focus on myself now and the man I want to be rather than who I was before today. I don’t care what your algorithm says, Facebook. I neither need nor want that memory popping up in my feed every year ad nauseam.&nbsp;</p><p>After some serious thought, my solution has been to compromise. I deleted my Facebook account that I’ve had since 2004. I’ve started clean, scaled back the friends list to a manageable level, and I plan to nurture those online relationships that are the most enduring, meaningful and mutually supportive.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p>A few weeks ago, I spent some much needed rest and relaxation in my home state of Michigan. Not only was it good for the soul to go back in summertime because northern Michigan is a true gem, it was an opportunity for me to introduce my partner to family and to show her some of the prettier parts of the state since she had only been to Flint (no offense, Flintstones). Besides, I was starting to get a little bit bitter about spending all of my vacation time on frigid Christmas holidays.</p><p>One of the biggest things I miss about home are the lakes. Their beauty and charm are ubiquitous to natives, but vague and seemingly pretty dull to a lot of people I’ve met in the west. Shar, upon seeing Lake Michigan for the first time, said:</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure >\n  <blockquote data-animation-role=\"quote\"\n   data-animation-override>\n    <span>&#147;</span>I have to admit, when you talked about the lakes and how awesome they are, I didn’t understand what the big deal was. I think most people don’t. I thought, ‘it’s a friggin’ lake - whoopty shit!’ Now I know. They’re like oceans.<span>&#148;</span>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n</figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p>I forgive her. In my experience, west coast natives have a terrible sense of geography for anything east of the Rockies. I don't blame them. There's just too much going on out here geographically speaking to care much about what's going on back east. But I still like surprising people who don't know any better with a trip to Sleeping Bear or the like.&nbsp;</p><p>Here in the west, there is the ocean and the mountains, all of which provide stunningly gorgeous scenery. I’m continually in awe of it all and their novelty hasn’t worn off yet. But there’s just something about the Great Lakes and the thousands of inland lakes in Michigan that give summer a different feel than what I’ve experienced here in the northwest. It’s peaceful and relaxing, and it seems like every other person or their family member has a cottage or second home on or near a lake of some sort. It is engrained in the culture of the place.&nbsp;</p><p>With the lakes come quaint lakeside villages and towns. It seems like they’re everywhere. Tourists flock to them in the warmer months, bringing much needed commerce. I don’t see the same thing here in Oregon or Washington. The major cities are amazing, dynamic places, but there just aren’t that many historic little towns to escape to. It’s pretty sad, actually.&nbsp;</p><p>But having lived in Michigan for 34 years, moving away, and then heading home for a week or two at a time as a tourist gives me some perspective. Those little towns, as comforting as they may be, are depressing places for most of the year, especially for some of the people who live there. There may be a few of them that can survive on skiers or snowmobilers bringing in some tourism dollars, and maybe a couple places have capitalized on being port cities, but there really isn’t much going on in terms of vibrant economies. Truth be told, I can romanticize them all I want, but they probably wouldn’t be great places to live full-time. Even if you’re lucky enough to be of retirement age with a substantial savings, chances are you’re a snowbird.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think the reasons for this situation have very much to do with the seasons changing. I think it has more to do with how their economies are structured, and more importantly, how we’ve chosen to structure our national economy — including allowing the middle class to shrink and the gap between the rich and poor widen.</p><p>There seem to be two schools of thought out there, both of which I think live in their own little myopic bubbles, yet both have truth to them. On the one side, people claim there would be better paying jobs if only we shopped locally - 'SHOP MAIN STREET!'&nbsp;they cry. A well-intentioned philosophy with some truth to it. The other argument is that if good-paying jobs weren’t shipped overseas and we didn’t make such little money, we could afford to support good local businesses. People would use their higher incomes to purchase goods in the local economy if there were better paying jobs, which would support still other jobs, etc. Again, well intentioned, but not the full story. The macro and the micro have to be taken into consideration together.</p><p>I’m very pro community and economic development and want to see local economies thrive. However, what bothers me the most about the ‘Shop Local’ movement is how some adherents to this philosophy seem to ignore the macroeconomics at play that are completely and utterly stacked against Main Street and the working classes. These days, ‘Shop Local’ is a privileged movement for middle to upper income people.&nbsp;</p><p>People shop at Walmart and Amazon and Walgreens because their budgets are squeezed, not because they don’t like Uncle John’s TV and Electronics Shop. And why shouldn't they? Who am I to judge the working class family who shops at Walmart so they can scrimp and save to put their kids through college? They're just working within the confines of the economic environment they've found themselves stranded in, where once vibrant and thriving economies have long since disappeared. Sure, people probably buy way too much shit. Big screen TVs, cell phones, unnecessary automobiles. You name it. But if the primary sectors of the economy in which our middle class was built are shipped off to places with cheap labor and little to no environmental standards, how can you expect them to spend what little disposable income they have on local shops? And I can assure you that spending money at Uncle John’s TV and Electronics Shop is not going to create any middle class jobs save for perhaps John. Maybe.&nbsp;</p><p>What our downtowns in small places have become are caricatures of their former selves and the play things for people who are well off. Take a look around the next time you’re in one of those places. There’s an ice cream shop and a few trinket shops hawking tourist goods like M-22 shirts and bumper stickers. But the majority of businesses in so-called thriving places are full of breweries and restaurants. As great as these things are — I literally had the best burger of my life at 7 Monks in Traverse City — these are the only types of businesses that can’t be outsources. Yet.&nbsp;And it’s not because people particularly enjoy spending $15 on a hamburger (usually). They're doing it for the convenience, but more importantly they're doing it because they like the atmosphere or the experience.</p><p>These things are privileges, unlike the days when there was only one appliance repair shop in town and you knew the owner by name. The days when a diverse downtown full of businesses providing necessary goods and services was a way of life.</p><p>As far as I know, there currently is no way efficiency, automation, or logistics can make a burger-eating experience more enjoyable. However, is it very difficult to imagine some not-so-distant future where people spend most of their time in their homes on virtual reality headsets attached to their phones while all of their food is delivered via Uber Eats?&nbsp;Is it that far-fetched when people can order all of their household goods from Amazon by simply saying the word \"Alexa - I need toilet paper\"?&nbsp;What would happen to our downtowns then?&nbsp;</p><p>There used to be businesses of all varieties, but those peddling everyday products and services can't compete anymore and they're not coming back. Totally gone the way of the buffalo. Should we be ashamed of this? In my personal opinion, yes, but that’s not why I’m writing this. What’s done is done. But what I would like to see is the locals acknowledge that “buying local” is a privileged perspective and that good-paying jobs are not in retail or restaurants. Any “buy local” campaign should be coupled with a strong economic development plan that goes beyond redeveloping or promoting Main Street.&nbsp;</p><p>There are other benefits to buying local. In my opinion, they are namely the positive impacts that retail and food industry jobs have on historic preservation, and the psychological and community impacts of living in a place that is vibrant at street level. These can, in some circumstances, attract larger economic drivers—sometimes even in small tourist towns. But this is not possible everywhere and let’s not continue to fool ourselves about the economic reality on the ground for most people when we talk about the importance of buying local.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "The Struggle is Real: How our Changing Environment can Turn Friends into Enemies",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <p>I've been thinking a lot about how a change in environment, whether physical or social, can cause people who might otherwise work together toward common goals to be at odds with one another. Sometimes these changes are caused by things beyond our control such as a natural disaster, but sometimes they are by design in order to keep us distracted from larger goals.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most interesting courses I took in college was an anthropology class on ancient civilization. We learned about Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, both part of what was known as the Fertile Crescent. What struck me was how these societies, despite their proximity to one another, evolved so differently. How was it that the Egyptians lived in relative peace for so long while Mesopotamia had so many warring tribes and no real semblance of unity? The difference, it is thought, has a lot to do with the rivers of the region.</p><p>The Nile, on the one hand, has always been pretty predictable in its course. Ancient Egyptians built their civilization upon its predictability, and because they were able to rely on it to irrigate their crops and provide water for basic needs, they built one of the greatest civilizations in history. Their society certainly was not without its problems, but it was relatively stable because the river’s course stayed true, and the region prospered for it. Economic wealth was certainly funneled up the chain of command, but people were generally able to provide for their livelihoods. On the other hand, the Tigris and Euphrates were not so reliable, and civilization there evolved very differently. These rivers have changed their courses many times over the millennia, and this fact had major impacts on the people of Mesopotamia.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine trying to farm alongside a river that periodically changed its course. In an arid region, irrigation is essential, so if you suddenly weren’t able to grow crops for your family, or if your community became extremely food insecure, it’s easy to imagine the stress this would cause. These periodic shifts in the courses of the rivers caused a lot of strife and wars to break out between different groups of people who fought for access to the waters. Although today the region’s problems are incredibly complex, there are some anthropologists who even argue that these rivers played such an important role in the region that their irregular courses and the strife this caused centuries ago laid the groundwork for the culture of conflict that exists in the Middle East to this day.</p><p>This may seem like a big leap, but I think the situation above is relatable to our modern lives and the political climate we are currently experiencing. Most of us in the U.S. may not have to worry so much about war, genocide, or a river shifting its course on us. At least not in a literal sense. But millions of Americans struggle with poverty and economic hardship within a quickly changing system that is very much the equivalent to a those shifting rivers in ancient times. It frightens me to think about our social safety net dissolving, and the resulting chaos that could ensue. What's sad is that I feel like sometimes, because of my privilege (perceived or real), that people view me as an enemy instead of an ally. I am a white male who is approaching middle age and I live a comfortable lifestyle. But that doesn't mean that I don't have something to contribute to the betterment of society.&nbsp;</p><p>As an adult, I didn't have what I would consider a middle class life until I was about 30, but I did have a social safety net. I had a family who backed me up, provided support when they could, and I had many luxuries by the very virtue of that sturdy ground my family relationships provided. I was lucky, even before I account for the privileges my race and gender afford me. I know that even the fact that I was able to go to school, fail, and go back again (twice if you count my master's degree) was an enormous privilege. As hard as it was to succeed at times, I know countless people did not have the same opportunities that I did, and I'm grateful for those I did have. Yet for someone as reflective and socially minded as I am (if I do say so myself), I struggle at times with accepting my privilege.</p><p>Sometimes it's hard to admit how good I really had it. Sometimes I get angry when people assume that I had everything handed to me or that I didn’t have to work for what I have. Like my hard work wasn't really work at all because of my privilege. I have to try hard to keep myself calm and not get personally offended when people assume I didn’t struggle because of my race or gender.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I fail miserably and lose sight of the larger goals of social justice in the face of defending my personal circumstances. I fail at times in formulating my ideas and in communicating my feelings with others. But I do take people's opinions to heart and try to understand their perspectives and hardships. I recognize my own shortcomings, for the most part, and know I still need to work on them. But, in my experience, the social justice warriors certainly don't make it easy to be on their team, either.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what bothers me most is the condescending tone from many people who are social justice-oriented. It bothers me a lot, despite me believing in and supporting many of the ideas they espouse and the policies they support. It feels bad to have my motives questioned when I share a differing opinion, like my actions are worth less than my words despite having worked 10 years in the affordable housing industry, for instance. To have my character questioned and my perspectives minimized simply because of my privilege does not feel good.&nbsp;</p><p>Make no mistake: I believe that all people should have similar footing and predictable ground on which to build a life and not be damned at birth by whatever station they were born into, or by their race or gender or sexual preference or anything else for that matter. Everyone should have a place where they have an opportunity to thrive and provide for themselves and their families. Furthermore, I think sometimes the only means we have in capitalism to provide those opportunities is through social programs.&nbsp;</p><p>I am angered and scared and saddened by the current administration and the potential for its policies to reek havoc on disadvantaged people from all walks of life. I’m scared for the people I serve at my job and what the future holds for some of them. I feel the swell of emotions and the fear is palpable. But my biggest fear of all is that the alienating language of social justice advocates to the ears of the majority will be counterproductive to the cause and we won’t get anything done.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't pretend to have a solution, and I don't mean to minimize the rage of the oppressed and less fortunate. Hell, if you're NOT angry, then you're not paying attention. But I feel like most people won't listen if they feel alienated. Would you? This is anecdotal, but I feel like the last election was indicative of that. There were other things at play, not least of which was misogyny. But I know a lot of progressive people who felt alienated by the Democratic campaign because it felt like a war was being waged against them because of their privilege.&nbsp;</p><p>We have to do better and that starts with, at very least, acknowledging those who are on our own team, and then having more productive and respectful conversations with each other. Let’s not allow these assholes to change the course of the river in order to divide and conquer. If we do, we'll have a lot more to deal with than just having a Cheeto-faced clown for another four years. We’ll have another swamp to drain.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\">\n  <h3>Your Identity is Not Defined by Who or where You Came From</h3><p>Over the years, and for as far back as I can remember, I was intensely interested in genealogy and the stories of my family’s heritage. Growing up, my biological father didn’t have a relationship with me. But even after he died, I kept in contact with his mother because she showed an interest in me and my brother. She was born in the US to Italian immigrants and I was always really intrigued by her stories of them. Like the one about my great grandfather being one of the construction workers who put the gold roof on the Fisher Building in Detroit.&nbsp;</p><p>For one reason or another, I always felt like that one-quarter Italian blood running through my veins was more important than the rest. I don’t think my feelings on this had anything to do with genetics or familial success. Those on my father’s side were neither particularly good looking nor very successful. What I’ve concluded is that it probably just had more to do with the fact that my Italian heritage was easily traced and that I had real stories going back to the mid-1800s in Vigo di Cadore. The other three quarters of my genetic makeup is such a mix that I never really knew where to start researching, and even though I did make some gains, I didn’t feel a connection to any of the other cultures the way that I did with my grandmother’s Italian heritage.</p><p>I don’t think I’m alone in this interest of researching my family’s past. It’s practically an American pastime to celebrate, usually in some comical or caricaturistic way, that drop or two of Irish or German blood we claim to have within us. What I suspect is that this pride of ours for heritage is somehow a combination of our collective national identity crisis stemming from the melting pot of our culture, a national philosophy steeped in individualism, and our human tendency toward tribalism. Who knows? What do I know?</p><p>Over the years, I’ve had my own fair share of pride in this regard. Periodically, I’d sign up for one of those Ancestry.com accounts where you can research your family heritage. But without fail, I’d usually end my subscription in frustration after only a month. Not because it wasn’t working; quite the opposite. I’d cut off my subscription because it was working <em>too</em> well.</p><p>If you’ve ever actually sat down and looked at a family tree, you might know what I mean about getting frustrated, even if you know a lot about your heritage already. These things start out easy. You write your own name down. Check. Then you write out your parents’ names, your grandparents’ names. You put on some coffee. You come back and maybe you know most of your great grandparents’ names and you ask Uncle Charlie for the others. Then it starts to get interesting. You start asking people for help filling in major gaps or you have to go digging through censuses and draft cards and ship manifests. This can be fun. If you don’t get frustrated at this point and you have some success in your research, the tree continues to grow, and it can grow damn fast, especially if you connect with other users with a common ancestor. At some point you will hit dead ends, but rest assured that each successive generation doubles, whether or not you know who contributed to your genetic makeup or not. A lot of people had sex to make you.</p><p>It’s even easier to visualize this doubling of ancestors that occurs each successive generation with what’s called a fan chart. It’s basically a series of successive circles that start out small. You occupy the center circle, your two parents in the second circle, your four grandparents in the third, etc. Each successive layer gets exponentially larger, and by the time you reach your 10th great grandparents, 2,048 people constitute the makeup of your gene pool. Ten generations might not be that far back, either. There’s usually 3-5 generations in each 100 year period.</p><p>If we think about deeper time, at least as it pertains to our species, some people estimate that humans as we know it have been walking this earth for about 200,000 years. And if the average generation is 25 years, that means there have been something on the order of 8,000 generations that came before you. Other scientists estimate that humans have only been around 50,000 years and current estimates of the number of people who have ever lived on earth is about 100 billion. That's 15 times the amount of people who are alive today. This fact inevitably left me with the feeling that researching my family’s heritage was little more than a fool’s errand.</p><p>Our egos may search for meaning in the past to help us define ourselves today, but we can only come back empty handed. By looking back, it’s my experience that we are not able to distill some powerful meaning out of our past from a handful of cultures or events or people we are blood relatives with. With any amount of time and reflection, we most often come to the realization that we are all beautifully diluted and that 99.9% of our makeup is the same genetic material as everyone else.</p><p>The point is, we are made up of the genetic code from a vast array of people, and every single one of those people lived a life of their own. Some of them were shitbags and some of them were saints and we’ll never know which were which or even who the vast majority of them were. Furthermore, no amount of historically significant information dug up on our relatives has any bearing on who we are today. We are our own accomplishments and failures, not theirs. &nbsp;</p><p>Still, throughout all of my research on my family tree, whenever I’d hit a dead end, I found myself wondering what might have happened to that person so that they left no trace and no further information to be found. They probably had children who loved them and parents in turn who probably loved them as well. But the branch just goes quiet. I think this speaks to one of our greatest fears. That’s the fear of our own branch dying, going quiet, and being forgotten.</p><p>Most of us would like to be remembered after we die. I’m not really sure why, but it’s probably the ego again wishing for some small part of us to remain immortal. Unfortunately, history has shown us that the people who are most likely to be remembered are those who were in power, and I’m inclined to believe that the majority of what we think we know about those people has been fabricated.</p><p>For the rest of us, your great-great-great grandkids likely won’t even know what your name was, let alone anything about who you were as a person. I don’t write that to be mean, either. It’s meant to help unburden you from any sort of ego-driven daydream that anyone is going to care about you when you’re gone. And that’s okay.</p><p>Neither the past nor the future matter nearly as much as we think, and being mindful of how you spend your time right now is the essence of living a meaningful life, not worrying about your legacy.</p><p>On the flip side, sometimes people view <em>you</em> as <em>their</em> legacy, which can be just as difficult to deal with as letting go of your own feelings on this topic. When family is closely involved in our lives, I think it can sometimes be very difficult to live our highest and best self when we sacrifice the best parts of ourselves or our own potential for family just because they are our blood relatives (mom’s excluded – happy Mother’s Day!). Besides the potential for being a huge drain on your time and energy, families are notorious for either putting unreasonable expectations on us or not allowing us to change for the better by consistently reminding us of who we were in the past. For many of us, family might be the single greatest thing holding us back from personal growth. If you find that certain family members are taking more energy from you than they are putting back in, or it doesn't feel like they're respecting your life choices, it might be time to reevaluate whether or not you should be investing so much in your relationship with them instead of respecting and loving yourself.</p><p>It’s easy to get bogged down worrying about the past or dreaming about the future. If you find yourself anxious about either one, I’ve personally found mindfulness exercises really helpful, and you might too. I won’t go into details here, but there are a bunch of resources and information on the web and many of the techniques are easy and can be incorporated into your everyday life without too much hassle. I took a 10-week mindfulness meditation course a couple of years back and it changed my entire outlook on life in short order. I recommend it. There are also a handful of apps out there to help you learn some new techniques.</p><p>Also, don’t sign up for Ancestry.com. It’s a total rip off.</p>\n</div>\n",

As admirable and necessary as those professions are, the world needs people from all walks of life and with all kinds of abilities and skillsets. From carpenters and artists to truck drivers and social workers, this post is for you.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who grew up in the wake of the post-industrial Midwest, I’ve had my fair share of struggle. I spent over half of my childhood in poverty and the majority of my twenties in crummy jobs and in even crummier cities. To be fair, there is a lot of good in the Midwest, and this post isn’t intended to rip on it. God knows it doesn’t need any more criticism. In fact, I’ve spent all of my professional career in the community development field, a lot of which was focused on trying to make those places better, and many of my closest friends are still working in those areas with the same goals. Things are getting better there and I commend the people who enjoy being there and working to improve it.&nbsp;</p><p>The major problem, in my mind, is that economies are far more elastic than the built environment. By this I mean that when times are good and a place is growing economically, humans tend to build things. We build roads, schools, housing, and infrastructure. All of this is financed by good jobs, whether through the taxes we pay or through the loans we take out to pay for them. We pay our mortgages and the government pays back the bonds it used to build the bridges. The problem occurs when the jobs evaporate. When the jobs disappear, so does the funding to pay for things to be built or maintained. People move away out of necessity and this creates a lack of demand for housing which in turn reduces their value and thus the taxes taken in by government. Things fall apart.&nbsp;</p><p>There is opportunity in the ashes. Cost of living generally goes down in these situations. If you’re lucky enough to have a good paying job, you can carve out a pretty good existence depending on where you’re willing to live and what you’re willing to endure. For instance, before moving to Portland I nearly bought a house in Michigan for $30,000. It needed a lot of work, but it was essentially habitable. The problem was that it wasn’t truly a place I wanted to live. I dreamed about moving away, but I couldn’t land a job elsewhere. I had resigned myself to making the best of a shitty situation. I was trying to look on the bright side. I dreamed up schemes where my cost of living was so low that I could basically go anywhere I wanted on vacations to help assuage the pain of being in a deep depression about where I lived. But that’s not what happened. There I was at 33 years old and hating my life primarily because of where I lived. &nbsp;</p><p>It may be helpful for you to know that there’s a lot of literature out there in the urban planning and community development worlds, both from the popular periodicals (CityLab/The Atlantic) and in the academic journals that argue that people are choosing the places they’d like to live prior to even landing a job. The academics are saying that people are choosing where to live based on certain places having the amenities people want and need to enjoy a fulfilling life. A nightlife, recreational opportunities, cool places to buy a coffee, etc.</p><p>Along those lines, here in Portland the joke has been that young people move here to retire. And what people in the Midwest are trying to do is improve their cities so that people will move there, hopefully to create jobs, start families, buy houses and cars, and contribute to the betterment of the economy. Some of them call it “placemaking”. That term may come and go out of fashion, but another name will take its place that essentially means the same thing. The bottom line is that a lot of smart people have looked at successful places and are trying to recreate them to a certain extent. It’s become formulaic in that people believe the form of the built environment—the shape and structure of buildings and the public realm—influence people’s psychology enough to want to be there. It’s like feng shui for cities in a way.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a lot of truth to it, even anecdotally. Think about it: who wants to live in a slum or spend time in a desolate, ugly downtown? Not many people I know, unless they’re really into taking photos of post-apocalyptic economic collapse. With placemaking, we start to see vestiges of life in once lifeless places. Coffee shops and bars open up, sporadically at first. Community development funding helps building owners tear down the crappy 1970s facades to expose the ornamental brick underneath. Streetscapes are remade and bike lanes are installed. Trees are planted and warehouses are converted to lofts. Streets are rolled back and burned out houses are demolished. All admirable things.&nbsp;</p><p>But the economic output just doesn’t increase the way it once did. At least not for awhile.&nbsp;Sure, the small businesses that employ an enormous amount of people come in, but they don’t bring in the same kind of prosperity that a Cadillac plant once did. What’s going on is that these places are in a slow transition period and have a lot more work to do. Those government officials will create slogans and brand their communities to try and make them seem cool and entice people to move there or to stay there. Hell, many of them are fabulously cool. But that doesn’t mean you should stay there.&nbsp;</p><p>What I think goes unnoticed are the masses of people who are woefully underemployed. I’m talking about the folks with degrees working in restaurants because they can’t find anything else and the construction workers who get laid off every single year. The auto worker who is technically employed at a temp agency and gets half the wages of the regular employee. Like myself before I landed my first professional job at 29, there are a lot of factors to consider when thinking about what’s keeping these people in those situations. For some, it’s proximity to family. For others, they’ve never known anything else. For me, it was the fear of taking the leap without knowing if anywhere else would be different in terms of getting a job. I was fearful of leaving without having landed a position to have the most basic sense of security.&nbsp;</p><p>How does this post have anything to do with minimalism and intentional living? Well, I’m writing this to let you know that you’re not alone if you’re struggling with being from a place that makes you feel like it doesn’t want you. Maybe you don’t see it on the surface, but you feel it when you can’t seem to get ahead in life no matter how hard you try. There may be structural issues at play beyond your control and the only way to correct it is to be as flexible as the economy that left you stranded.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course there is personal responsibility at play as well. Education is a major factor in economic mobility. But there are places right now where there are shortages of workers. Maybe you should ask yourself what is holding you back? For me, it was fear. Fear of the unknown and fear of failure. But once I made the leap, so many things seemed to fall into place. My only regret is that I didn’t try it sooner. I took the safe route and wasted away years of my life in a place that made me feel like it didn’t want me.&nbsp;</p><p>If there’s anything I’ve learned on my journey toward a more intentional lifestyle, it’s that if I would have refocused my priorities early on, I could have saved myself a lot of headaches. I think if I could do it all over again, and if I'd have known then what I know now, I would’ve pared down my possessions to the bare minimum, worked my ass off to pay off all of my debt, and then I would have just leapt for it. I would’ve lived out of my car if I had to and just gone for it. Maybe applied for some temp jobs or worked for Uber or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>I want you to know that if you did the same, you’d probably be okay. Honestly, you’ll probably be better than okay. The worst that could happen is that you have to go back to where you’re from. Your state loves you and it’s giving you away. If you have to go back, maybe it's meant to be.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>For someone who studied urban planning, I am not naturally very good at planning ahead for activities in my everyday life, particularly when it comes to how I spend my precious free time. I got into planning because I like cities and I want them to be better places for people to live. But planning for my own happier existence just isn't one of my natural strengths. I've had plenty of happy moments, to be sure, and not all happy moments are planned. But I have to be very intentional and focused to change my natural inclination to <em>not</em> plan ahead because I think it's an important ingredient to living a meaningful life.</p><p>For as far back as I can remember, I've been more of a go-with-the-flow type of person. I like spontaneity, and still value it. And more than likely if someone suggests that we do something fun and I don't already have plans, I'm probably going along for the ride. But there was a time when I relied too heavily on other people to bring value into my life by hitching onto<em> their</em> plans.</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with allowing others to bring value into your life. But if you rely on other people for your happiness, you're also giving other people a lot of control over your time, focus, energy, and resources. You may also be putting your friendships at risk if there is a lack of reciprocity by not bringing value into your friends' lives if you're leaning too heavily on them to support your own happiness. </p><p>Now that spring is upon us, it's the perfect time to plan some summer get-togethers or getaways. You may already have been bombarded with invitations to open houses, weddings, barbecues, and camping trips. If not, I assure you they will come. Sooner than you think. You may even feel an obligation to fill up your calendar with everything that comes your way. But know that planning ahead allows you to be more selective. Planning is being intentionally selfish with your time, but not in the negative sense of the word 'selfish'. The positive form of selfishness ultimately empowers you to spend your time doing what makes you happy with those people who make you feel the happiest. Choice is happiness.</p><p>Before your calendar fills up and spring comes to an end, take a look ahead and think about how you actually want to spend your time this summer. Block out an hour or two on your calendar this weekend (with your partner if you have one) and start brainstorming some of your bucket list items and how you can make them reality in the coming months. If you're tight on cash, think of creative ways to save a little money right now. I'm currently trying out an app called Qapital which helps me save automatically whenever I swipe my card. Without getting too wonky, there are even some cool integrations with the app IFTTT which can reward your savings account when you do things like reach your Health app step count for the day. Maybe it will work for you. Alternatively, maybe you can sell some things from around the house when you get your spring cleaning done. Get creative.</p><p>Even though I'm not a natural planner, I love that slow build of anticipation and excitement that comes with waiting for a trip that I've planned, even if I'm only going away for a long weekend. For a couple of months now, my partner and I have been anticipating a trip to the redwoods, a bucket list item I've wanted to check off for a few years. There is absolutely nothing extravagant or spectacular about what we've planned (aside from the trees, the trees! And if you didn't know, its National Parks Week! Admission is free to parks for Earth Day weekend!). But the anticipation makes it so much sweeter, especially after the hibernation-inducing winter we had. And most of all, it allows us to spend some time on our values instead of letting others dictate them for us.</p>\n",

In fact, I consider myself something of a thrifting master. I once bought a $5,000 stainless steel grill for $75 at the Habitat ReStore in Beaverton, OR. I think I must have inherited this gene from my grandmother, whose superhero qualities included going to garage sales to find stellar deals, and digging damaged items out of dumpsters and fixing them up.</p><p>I do my thrifting by frequenting second hand stores on my lunch breaks. I think there must be something to that whole 'retail therapy' thing, because it's just something that I really enjoy doing, even if I don't buy anything. It's a time for me to clear my head and just let my creativity flow. But I think, more than anything, I enjoy it so much because it's fascinating to me what others choose to discard. The whole experience is enlightening because it becomes pretty apparent really quickly what we collectively don't value anymore, especially when some of the wares up for sale seemed ubiquitous or essential when they first arrived on the scene. TiVo readily comes to mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the obsolete electronics, dated furniture, and home decor, there are the racks and racks of clothing, most of which was made cheaply by small hands in factories in far off lands. Our clothing has become as disposable as paper plates at a Memorial Day barbecue. And this just couldn't be possible without the cheap labor that makes the end products so affordable, and thus more easily disposable. For more information on this, there is an excellent documentary you can watch on Netflix called '<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://truecostmovie.com/\">The True Cost</a>'.</p><p>That increase in clothing supply and cheap access has no doubt been a boon for nonprofit second hand clothing stores and the services they provide. Putting aside my own judgments as best I can, I'm sure the outcome of this cheap clothing economy has also been a much welcomed reprieve by those relatively less financially fortunate Americans among us who want to feel the sense of normalcy and belonging that can come with wearing certain types of clothing, as fleeting as that feeling can be. Although I care very little about branding outside of it sometimes being helpful in predicting the likelihood of buying a durable product, I recognize that this is a privileged perspective to have. Growing up in a low-income household, there weren't many things more important to me at the time than just feeling like I was normal, that I belonged, and few things had the power to equalize me amongst my more fortunate peers than a new pair of Nikes, for example.</p><p>Not too long ago, I found some of those same wants and desires from childhood finding their way out again, and they began leading me down a rabbit hole. I started picking up clothing from thrift stores on a weekly basis. Before long, my closet was completely full. But what I found was not only did I not feel more fulfilled, I actually felt a negative impact on my life.</p><p>The thing is, I wasn't really saving any money by 'thrifting'. I was under the illusion that since I was spending less per item that I was actually saving money. But all those small purchases added up to more than I would spend on just a handful of high quality things. On top of this, mornings were stressful because I had a more difficult time deciding what to wear because I had more in my closet. Laundry day was also an enormous hassle because I could let my clothes pile up because I had more clean clothes to wear. This year I finally said enough is enough and cleared out about 90% of my wardrobe.</p><p>Although my partner sometimes gets annoyed with me because I have a tendency to leave things in the dryer since I wear the same things over and over, laundry day is now a breeze. It's usually a one and done scenario, unless we're doing towels or bedding. Mornings are a lot smoother as well, and I generally alternate between wearing 2 different colored pairs of dress pants to work Monday through Thursday, and I wear my favorite pair of jeans on Fridays. I have probably 10 dress shirts, a handful of really comfortable t-shirts, a couple of hoodies and sweaters, and a few pairs of shorts, but that's about it. Oh, and I got rid of all but my most worn pairs of shoes. I have a brown pair of work shoes, one black and one brown pair of dress shoes, a pair of running shoes, 2 pairs of casual shoes, and a pair of sandals. That may sound like a lot, but I use all 7 regularly as each pair has an intended purpose.</p><p>So now when I go to the thrift store, I am more deliberate about what I pick up. I'm usually on a mission for something very specific, but if I run across an item that I really like, I will usually skip it unless it's an upgrade to something I already have. In that situation, I do a 1-for-1 swap in my wardrobe. Life has been a lot simpler ever since.</p>\n</div>\n",

You'd think with all of that experience that I'd have moving down to a science.&nbsp;But every time, without fail, I'd view the experience of packing with such dread that I'd procrastinate until the very last minute. I'd putz around, packing some things away, but I'd easily get distracted by some sentimental item I would come across and ponder it for awhile, or I'd just get frustrated and look around and think, \"how did I get so much <em>crap</em>?\" Usually on the last weekend of my lease I'd end up in a mad scramble,&nbsp;throwing everything that was left in the apartment into boxes, completely unorganized. It was chaos.&nbsp;</p><p>In July of 2016, I purchased my first home and moved out of the 500 sq. ft. apartment I was renting in downtown Portland.&nbsp;I wish I could say it was a different experience moving out of my apartment, but it wasn't. What was different, however, was how I decided to move into my house.</p><p>My friend Justin came down from Seattle to help me move, but instead of dragging everything into the house immediately, I only brought in the essentials. What little furniture I had, some of my clothes, toiletries, and kitchenware. Over the course of the next six months, I brought things in from the garage as I needed them. I left the boxes open and just periodically took from them the items that proved to be the most useful. Sure, it was a little messy in the garage at times. A mouse even ate my favorite suit. But it became apparent pretty quickly what things were bringing the most value to my life and those that were just dead weight.</p><p>For the last several months, I have been ridding the garage of the stuff I haven't been using. Donating things that others might find useful, recycling what I can, and trashing the rest. It's been really challenging at times because I didn't fully realize how much of the clutter was due to how attached I'm capable of becoming to things, even if I haven't really used or needed them in a really long time. Those items that remain are mostly sentimental, but what I have left seems really manageable. I think I will be mostly done by the end of this month.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also starting to feel my outlook changing whenever I'm deciding whether or not to buy something new. I didn't get myself into a cluttered situation overnight. It took years and years of unchecked accumulation to get there. But the last thing I want to do is start the whole process over again.</p><p>I'm considering getting rid of my Amazon Prime account because I'm just not ordering much these days to even make the $10.99/mo for free shipping worth it anymore. And when I'm at a store, I find myself seriously questioning the purchases I make, and being more intentional about what I bring into my space. The first thing I ask myself is whether or not the thing I'm looking at is a want or a need. If it is a need, the second question is usually, \"how much useful life am I going to get out of this<em> thing</em>?\"</p><p>I probably won't be moving again for a long time, and it's a little bit ironic that it took putting down some roots in a larger space to finally declutter.&nbsp; But I have to say, it's been really freeing, and I can feel my stress level decrease just a little bit more every time I take the donation box down to the second hand store.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find yourself getting stressed out thinking about an upcoming move, I challenge you not to move out the way I did. Look around and take an honest inventory of what things you are getting regular use out of and those things that aren't bringing you as much value anymore. I bet if you lighten your load, the move won't be nearly as bad. It will just feel better, because being lighter feels good.</p><p> </p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>On their very popular podcast, the Minimalists recently posted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.theminimalists.com/p028/\">an episode</a> on debt. Generally I think the ideas they espouse are really good, and I've learned a lot of helpful tips from them. In a country where far too many people live in excess, the Minimalists provide a road map for people interested in living happier lives with less.</p><p>However, for those who enjoy their podcast as much as I do, you may have been as disappointed as I am with some of their views on debt. Ryan Nicodemus sort of takes a back seat on this topic, and actually seems more reasonable than Joshua Fields Millburn, suggesting that debt can be used responsibly if necessary. In this episode, Ryan's view is to take on as little debt as you can and pay it off as quickly as possible. Josh, on the other hand, takes an extreme stance that any and all debt is bad — and that the only option is to pay it off immediately — even at the expense of your sanity, precious time, or opportunity costs.</p><p>My suggestion is to not be too hard on yourself if you have certain kinds of debt. Obviously, take an honest assessment of your individual situation and use your gut. If you want to get on a path to freedom from debt, talk to a financial advisor or a friend who is good with their finances if you don’t have the skills yourself. In most cases, the quick payoff is the smartest way to go.</p><p>I won’t go into depth on the Minimalists' ideas about financing your education. Sure, in a perfect world, no one would graduate with any debt for trying to better themselves with higher education. The system is naturally flawed. But just because you did not plan on becoming a doctor or lawyer doesn't mean that it was a bad decision to take on student debt to get ahead and give you leverage to follow your passion. Sure, there are arguments for not getting a degree in certain situations. Sometimes you can work your ass of for a decade, proving yourself over and over again before finally (maybe) winning the lottery for that job of your dreams. But for the vast majority of us, that just isn't an option. Getting a degree is the quickest path to success.</p><p>The long-term earning potential for a college graduate far outweighs the costs over a lifetime. Someone who holds a bachelor’s degree earns almost double that of someone with a high school diploma, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_chart_001.htm\">on average</a>. Should you minimize the debt you take on? Absolutely. Schools should also do a better job to help students understand the long-term implications of taking on student debt so that a financed summer in Italy or spring break in Cabo just don't look so compelling to an 18 year old.</p><p>In the Minimalists' episode on debt, one caller posed a question via voicemail. She took on $70,000 in debt to go to graduate school and now works for a nonprofit. She is part of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and her question for Josh and Ryan was whether or not she should just pay it all off as quickly as possible or put in the 10 years in public service required of the program and have the remaining debt be forgiven? At first, Ryan started by saying that those programs are there for a reason, but Josh quickly responded that she should just “pay it off as soon as possible.\"</p><p>This is where I wholeheartedly disagree. Because of math. Let's begin with the fact that there is no way for her to erase her decision to take on this debt. Even in bankruptcy, student loans do not go away. However, by working in a public service field, she has the opportunity to have some of her debt forgiven through the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service\">Public Service Loan Forgiveness</a> (PSLF) program through the U.S. Department of Education. Under this program, if you do not make a lot of money (a meaningful career in public service — go figure), you can get on an Income-Driven Repayment Plan. These programs can limit your student loan payments to 10% of your discretionary income, as defined by the amount you make over a certain percentage of the national poverty line. If your loans are big enough, you may not pay even the interest on that loan. I know that sounds scary, but hear me out. After 10 years of payments in a public service job, the remainder of your loan is forgiven. And guess what else? All of that interest that you pay? It’s a tax write-off (up to $2500/yr). Depending on your income, you could get a pretty substantial percentage of your payments back at the end of each tax year.</p><p>Below I run a few basic repayment scenarios outlining why JFM's advice is not only financially bad, but why, in my opinion, it is counter intuitive to a minimalist lifestyle.</p><p>Bear with me while we look at some repayment examples.</p><p> </p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Scenario 1 — Normal Payment Plan:</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">$70,000, 7.5%, minimum payment ($517.29) @ 25 years (normal gov’t pmt plan) = $155,188.15 paid in both principal and interest.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Scenario 2 —Pay Off ASAP (assumes double payments):</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">$70,000, 7.5%, double payments ($1034.58) @ 7 years 5 months = $91,277 paid in both principal and interest.</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>Scenario 3 — The PSLF Program:</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\">$70,000, 7.5%, income based repayment plan ($400 @ 2% increases annually due to income growth) = $52,558 repaid (the rest forgiven).</p><p style=\"margin-left:40px\"> </p><p>Potential savings on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program as compared to the double payment scenario is <strong>$38,719</strong>. And that doesn't even include the tax benefits of up to $2500/yr.</p><p>This is no small sum. Think of all of the things you could do with that money, not least of which would be saving for retirement.</p><p>With a conservative hourly wage at a nonprofit earning $20/hr is $31,200/year after taxes, or $2,600 per month. Double student loan payments would be almost 50% of their income for 7.5 years. We in the affordable housing realm have a name for paying 50% of your income on anything: poverty.</p><p>If she paid the recommended 30% of her income on housing, which is nearly impossible these days with the way that rent is going up, she would be left with about $600-700 per month for ALL of the rest of her needs for <strong>seven and a half years. </strong>That's less than what the average person living on social security and living in public housing makes.</p><p>I can all but guarantee that if she takes their advice that she is going to have the most miserable seven and half years of her life scrimping and budgeting, all while she was trying to have a <em>better</em> life by going to college, not a worse one.</p><p>The opportunity costs, wasted time, wasted money, and lower quality of life all to repay something that would be forgiven anyway just does not compute for me. We can debate whether or not it was a good idea to get into this much debt in the first place, but the ideas presented on the program represent unsound financial advice.</p>\n</div>\n",

Other times, I may not recommend a product at all, but instead an experience or life tip or creative work that I've found useful or beautiful and would like to share. Why 30? Well, because it rhymes with 'sturdy' and it seems like a manageable number to maintain. Keepin' it simple.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to own and buy less stuff and experience as much as I can and I know there are a lot of people out there who share these same values. Whether the intent is to be better stewards of the environment, to save money, or just simplify or enrich your existence, I hope the list will be of value to you. When recommending products, I will try to take into consideration where and how it is made or manufactured.&nbsp;</p><p>But I'm only one person and I want the list to be updated regularly. If you have suggestions that you'd like me to consider, please send them my way! Sharing is caring.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Since I have Fridays off, I had a four day weekend due to the holiday today. I could use more of these. I didn't get any reading done like I had planned, but I had a fun and relaxing weekend regardless.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Kate and I went down to Cedar Point to indulge our need for some cheap excitement. I wasn't feeling the best that day, but we still got in seven or so big coaster rides that shook my general malaise and made me feel truly alive for the first time since I can't remember when. I almost got sick on the Millennium Force, but the initial drop of over 300 feet got me ramped up with a big shot of adrenaline!</p>\n<p>I made it a point to not shy away from any coaster, despite my fear of heights. I wanted to feel afraid. I probably feared Power Tower the most. Usually there are long lines, but since it's an older ride, we got right on it, without the usually mental prep that goes along with waiting and watching others experience it. Power Tower is an ominously tall tower that either shoots you up&hellip;or drops you down. We did the version that drops you down. You get cranked up to the top and you sit there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds and the view of lake Erie is tremendous. It was the only thing that kept me from freaking out up at the top. And when it shoots you down the long steel beams faster than gravity, you really almost have an out-of-body experience. At least that's what it felt like to me.</p>\n<p>Top Thrill Dragster was by far the most intense, but still incredibly fun. It shoots you to 120 mph in a matter of a couple seconds down a steel course like a dragstrip, only then to be projected straight up in the air over 400 feet, rolled over a curve that points you straight down, and then careened 270 degrees while still vertical, and back to the origin of the ride. It's short, but that's the fun bit. You're not jolted, save for the initial launch of 120 mph, and you have just enough time to get scared out of your mind before you're back down to the safe ground at sea level. By far my favorite ride at the place.</p>\n<p>The only disappointing thing about the park is that the people there seemed so trashy. I really tried not to judge people too much, but when you're waiting in an hour-long line for a ride, you get pretty up close and personal with a lot of strangers. The girls dressed so raunchy and the guys were all Hollister-wearing surfer wannabees or dirty backwater Midwesterners. I guess that's what I should have expected at a place designed for cheap thrills. But this didn't ruin the day, it was just eye-opening, especially since I don't have a lot of contact with teenyboppers in my everyday life.</p>\n<p>Saturday I went to the lake with my folks and it was jam packed with the same kind of people. A lot of bad tattoos and guys trying to be macho, poor people with kids trying to get a cheap, yet fun, weekend in before they went back to their blue collar lives on Tuesday. I feel like an outsider in those situations, like I don't know how to interact with these Michigan lifers. I know they exist everywhere, but I have to admit that outside of the South, the Midwest probably has the most uncultured white trash in the U.S. I know because I used to be one of them. All the while I try to be more accepting of people, but my lack of understanding of the lives they appear to live has me mind boggled. Funny part is, many of them are no doubt more happy than I am, so who am I to judge?</p>\n<p>I'm not wanting to start the week tomorrow, but it's inevitable. I'm going to get some cleaning and laundry done so I don't have to think about it during the week. Hopefully this weekend recharged my batteries enough to get me through for a couple of weeks. Our next trip will be a small one to Saugatuck on Lake Michigan, where hopefully the quaint beach town feel and lack of campgrounds will keep the crazies away long enough for a nice, calm weekend.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I've found my way back here because of an old friend who always has the right things to say.  The funny thing is, I don't even know where to start because I've been bottling things up for so long that I feel like I could explode into a mess of flesh and Type O Positive all over the tacky wayne's coating of my parents' basement.  I guess I'll start small, with humility, and without lying to myself anymore.  The truth is, I haven't been happy in a really long time.  I was just tired of being unhappy and looking unhappy and sounding unhappy, so I adopted a &quot;keep on the sunny side of life&quot; facade, always trying to find the optimist inside of me.  In doing so, I neglected a lot of negative energy that should have naturally come out of me in small bits.  They are instead now causing nervous breakdown.  I thought that writing in this shit once again would help organize some of my thoughts, and vent out some of my frustration.  Sounds so generic to say that.  But I'm not going to worry about how things sound.  I need to do this.  Besides, anything over 2 lines in a journal entry always gets skimmed over anyways.  Don't worry, I do it too.  I'm a hypocrite.</p>\n<p>I have trouble talking.  It's not that I don't have anything to say, I really do.  My mind races fast with thoughts, but I can't organize them to come out how they should.  I linger on statements in my mind before they get filtered down to my mouth, and they never come out as I plan.  I pay too close attention to what comes from my mouth, with many pauses.  I envy those people who can flow at the mouth as if there were no second thought to what is being said, even if what they are saying is complete and utter garbage in my mind.  I call up my friend Derek out west and he's got this brilliant head on him.  I don't think he would be offended if I said that he's not what you would call &quot;book smart&quot;, but fuck if this kid doesn't have the wit and quickness.  He will drive the conversation about his life and somehow make even the most average of everday occurances completely original and awe-inspiring.  I don't think I've ever told him that, but Derek, if you're reading this, I really look up to you and admire your fresh look on things.  I wish I had that.  I just can't think like you do.</p>\n<p>Second is my apathy, which controls life situations as well as speech.  I don't really watch TV, so I can't speak about that.  I barely even watch or listen to the news anymore.  It all sounds like hell and I can't even form my own opinions on what I should feel about certain situations and topics.  Perhaps I'm just a coward and afraid to be wrong.  I don't have a mind for names, so even if I do watch or hear something, I can never remember who was in it.  I can't tell a story for shit.  Music is another thing.  I've stopped playing music and that really bothers me.  I barely even keep up on music anymore and that really bothers me.  But at the same time I just don't care to try.  I only read one book all summer.  Usually I read at least 6 or 7.  The scary part is, if I have any down time at all, all I want to do is sit or lie on the couch.  I don't like that about myself.  I don't like that I can zone out of my life and be complete apathetic about the direction in which it is going, or the person I am becoming.</p>\n<p>There are things in my life that I should feel proud of, but I don't.  I'm a senior at at top university in the country and all i can do is kick myself in the ass for not getting it done sooner.  I came back to finish a mistake, to finish something I started, and I'm doing well, doing really well, and all I can think about is if I'm doing the right thing.  If I shouldn't have cared so much about this stupid degree.  I don't feel any smarter than I was when I started back up, and by the time I'm done I'll be 25k in debt (even after the thousands of dollars in grant money).  I feel sometimes that I should have followed my passions more instead of compromising myself for this thing we call &quot;growing up&quot;.  I've just been poor for so long that I wonder what it's like to have nights and weekends off and enough money to actually survive on.  I see tons of people that I went to high school with that are married with children and a house and a nice car, and even though I don't want most of these things at this point in my life, I feel like I'm judged for not having them.  I feel smarter and more creative than most, yet here they are &quot;successful&quot; by society's standards.  I need some validation of my own.  Sometimes I just need someone else to tell me that I'm doing the right thing.  But where is the moral support these days?  We're all just supposed to suck it up and expect nothing from nobody because we're adults now and we can only rely on ourselves.</p>\n<p>I've learned a lot about myself the last few months, while dating Sarah.  Come to find out, we're almost emotionally identical.  So getting mad at each other was like getting mad at one's self, to find fault in the other was to find fault in one's self.  I'm actually furious at her right this moment, but in being so I have to be mad at Bryan.  Bryan doesn't like that.  Bryan is a stubborn bastard.  Bryan shouldn't refer to self in the third person.  Maybe this is a topic best left for a later post, for this is ending up to be a nonsensical bunch of words on a page with no order.  I don't really care anymore.  At this point I'm just talking and letting the words flow as they come because I'm so sick of them staying, battering me from the inside, and giving me headaches.  Sarah and I broke up, and I think it's for the better, but I've always been the nostalgic type and have never found it to be easy to let anyone go from my life.  I'm sure many can attest to that.  Done for now.</p>\n",

I don&apos;t like that I can zone out of my life and be complete apathetic about the direction in which it is going, or the person I am becoming.\n\nThere are things in my life that I should feel proud of, but I don&apos;t.  I&apos;m a senior at at top university in the country and all i can do is kick myself in the ass for not getting it done sooner.  I came back to finish a mistake, to finish something I started, and I&apos;m doing well, doing really well, and all I can think about is if I&apos;m doing the right thing.  If I shouldn&apos;t have cared so much about this stupid degree.  I don&apos;t feel any smarter than I was when I started back up, and by the time I&apos;m done I&apos;ll be 25k in debt (even after the thousands of dollars in grant money).  I feel sometimes that I should have followed my passions more instead of compromising myself for this thing we call &quot;growing up&quot;.  I&apos;ve just been poor for so long that I wonder what it&apos;s like to have nights and weekends off and enough money to actually survive on.  I see tons of people that I went to high school with that are married with children and a house and a nice car, and even though I don&apos;t want most of these things at this point in my life, I feel like I&apos;m judged for not having them.  I feel smarter and more creative than most, yet here they are &quot;successful&quot; by society&apos;s standards.  I need some validation of my own.  Sometimes I just need someone else to tell me that I&apos;m doing the right thing.  But where is the moral support these days?  We&apos;re all just supposed to suck it up and expect nothing from nobody because we&apos;re adults now and we can only rely on ourselves.\n\nI&apos;ve learned a lot about myself the last few months, while dating Sarah.  Come to find out, we&apos;re almost emotionally identical.  So getting mad at each other was like getting mad at one&apos;s self, to find fault in the other was to find fault in one&apos;s self.  I&apos;m actually furious at her right this moment, but in being so I have to be mad at Bryan.  Bryan doesn&apos;t like that.  Bryan is a stubborn bastard.  Bryan shouldn&apos;t refer to self in the third person.  Maybe this is a topic best left for a later post, for this is ending up to be a nonsensical bunch of words on a page with no order.  I don&apos;t really care anymore.  At this point I&apos;m just talking and letting the words flow as they come because I&apos;m so sick of them staying, battering me from the inside, and giving me headaches.  Sarah and I broke up, and I think it&apos;s for the better, but I&apos;ve always been the nostalgic type and have never found it to be easy to let anyone go from my life.  I&apos;m sure many can attest to that.  Done for now.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>My brother is coming home on leave from Iraq in a couple of days.  It's going to be nice to see him.  Have a few drinks and play some cards.  It's always funny when he comes home because they aren't allowed alcohol in Iraq, and he always gets really shitty and funny drunk when he comes home.  Last time he ordered some of this bunk-ass absinthe and sent it home so it'd be waiting for him when he returned.  Notwithstanding the bunkness of the absinthe itself, the alcohol content was way up there, and little to say we polished it.  Us Robb's are pretty funny drunks.  We it's fun rambling about old times.</p>\n<p>I remember when we were just little kids, when we we're going to Westdale Elementary in Saginaw.  I was in first grade and he was in Pre-K.  We used to get into fights all the time.  There were these two book bags that we had and since we were pretty poor, one of the bags was really plain, and the other was this decidely ugly and uncool cheap plaid bag that was totally tattered.  We used to fight over whose turn it was to have the plain bag for the day because we didn't like being seen with the plaid one.  How ridiculous we were!  We always went to the richie schools but always lived in the smallest, poorest section of the school districts.  When we moved to Midland it was even worse.  We lived in a small two bedroom apartment while all of our friends lived in these huge and gorgeous places that used to make me feel sick to my stomach with envy when I'd walk home from school.  Of course we always walked.  We would have rather died than be seen dropped off in our old stationwagon.  Looking back I feel so foolish thinking that money was such a great thing, and the hell my mother must have put up with raising us alone on what she could.

				"content_text": "My brother is coming home on leave from Iraq in a couple of days.&nbsp; It&apos;s going to be nice to see him.&nbsp; Have a few drinks and play some cards.&nbsp; It&apos;s always funny when he comes home because they aren&apos;t allowed alcohol in Iraq, and he always gets really shitty and funny drunk when he comes home.&nbsp; Last time he ordered some of this bunk-ass absinthe and sent it home so it&apos;d be waiting for him when he returned.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the bunkness of the&nbsp;absinthe itself, the alcohol content was way up there, and&nbsp;little to say we polished it.&nbsp; Us Robb&apos;s are pretty funny drunks.  We it&apos;s fun rambling about old times.\n\nI remember when we were just little kids, when we we&apos;re going to Westdale Elementary in Saginaw.  I was in first grade and he was in Pre-K.  We used to get into fights all the time.  There were these two book bags that we had and since we were pretty poor, one of the bags was really plain, and the other was this decidely ugly and uncool cheap plaid bag that was totally tattered.  We used to fight over whose turn it was to have the plain bag for the day because we didn&apos;t like being seen with the plaid one.  How ridiculous we were!  We always went to the richie schools but always lived in the smallest, poorest section of the school districts.  When we moved to Midland it was even worse.  We lived in a small two bedroom apartment while all of our friends lived in these huge and gorgeous places that used to make me feel sick to my stomach with envy when I&apos;d walk home from school.  Of course we always walked.  We would have rather died than be seen dropped off in our old stationwagon.  Looking back I feel so foolish thinking that money was such a great thing, and the hell my mother must have put up with raising us alone on what she could.  My brother and I used to come home after school and nobody was there to watch us because my mom was at work.  She was making just enough money to not qualify for any assistance, and our father was never in the picture so he never sent money.  Sometimes we&apos;d forget the key and we wouldn&apos;t have anyway of getting in the apartment.  Sometimes, if we were lucky, we could climb up to the second floor balcony by stepping on the gas lines that ran up the side of the building.

I'm moved out of my apartment and it really didn't take more than two days to get everything organized, packed up, and moved.  There is one thing that I'm neglecting, though, and it's painting over the walls.  I shouldn't have ever done it, being that it's an apartment but I was tired of living in mind-numbing white.  Hopefully I'll finish that up tonight.</p>\n<p>I've been thinking about heading over to the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship as a spectator on one Sunday to see what they're all about.  I'm not really into organized religion, and I'm sure those who know me the best would say that I've said more than my fair share against them.  But I think that these people are kind of the anti-religious-establishment establishment.  I was researching their stuff and at very least they sound uncommonly interesting to me.  They're so open minded that I've been wanting to check them out for the sheer sense of community&hellip;and possibly so I can do some volunteer work.  I don't know what I'd do, but I feel that I've got a lot to be thankful for, and there are plenty out there that have nothing, so why not do what I can instead of griping about things all the time.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Also, I'm probably a little late on this train by a couple of months, but I've been listening to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bloc Party<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it may just be true that they saved music for me.  I was starting to think that there were no truly sincere bands out there&hellip;that also whaled like nobody's business.  These folks most certainly do, and I'm rockin' it like it's hot.  Don't listen to the hype, just grab the album <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silent Alarm<!-- raw HTML omitted --> before you're the last person on earth who hasn't heard this heroic band.  Also, I'm pretty damned excited about the 6 re-releases of all the Super Furry Animals discs.  Too bad I'm pretty much flat.  British Sea Power also.  I do have the ole iPod.  Someday I'm going to need and repent for not paying these wonderful people.

				"content_text": "It&apos;s times like these that I&apos;m glad that I don&apos;t keep a lot of personal possessions.  I&apos;m moved out of my apartment and it really didn&apos;t take more than two days to get everything organized, packed up, and moved.  There is one thing that I&apos;m neglecting, though, and it&apos;s painting over the walls.  I shouldn&apos;t have ever done it, being that it&apos;s an apartment but I was tired of living in mind-numbing white.  Hopefully I&apos;ll finish that up tonight.\n\nI&apos;ve been thinking about heading over to the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship as a spectator on one Sunday to see what they&apos;re all about.  I&apos;m not really into organized religion, and I&apos;m sure those who know me the best would say that I&apos;ve said more than my fair share against them.  But I think that these people are kind of the anti-religious-establishment establishment.  I was researching their stuff and at very least they sound uncommonly interesting to me.  They&apos;re so open minded that I&apos;ve been wanting to check them out for the sheer sense of community...and possibly so I can do some volunteer work.  I don&apos;t know what I&apos;d do, but I feel that I&apos;ve got a lot to be thankful for, and there are plenty out there that have nothing, so why not do what I can instead of griping about things all the time.\n\n<img src=&quot;http://www.trainsaw.com/images/monk.jpg&quot;>\n\nAlso, I&apos;m probably a little late on this train by a couple of months, but I&apos;ve been listening to <b>Bloc Party</b> and it may just be true that they saved music for me.  I was starting to think that there were no truly sincere bands out there...that also whaled like nobody&apos;s business.  These folks most certainly do, and I&apos;m rockin&apos; it like it&apos;s hot.  Don&apos;t listen to the hype, just grab the album <b>Silent Alarm</b> before you&apos;re the last person on earth who hasn&apos;t heard this heroic band.  Also, I&apos;m pretty damned excited about the 6 re-releases of all the Super Furry Animals discs.  Too bad I&apos;m pretty much flat.  British Sea Power also.  I do have the ole iPod.  Someday I&apos;m going to need and repent for not paying these wonderful people.  My logic - they&apos;re a lot richer than I am, and they&apos;re not eating kraft dinner...so when I&apos;m old and loaded from retirement and booze, I&apos;ll go through the old collection, and any band that I feel changed me positively in some way...I&apos;ll buy two of every copy.

They who looked down their noses at people who were not like themselves, and then had the audacity to not follow their own convictions.&nbsp; The comedy of it all is that we were just as hypocritical as they.&nbsp; And we secretly looked down our noses at <EM>them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</EM>On a side note, this reminds me of something my friend Ashley once said to me:</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial>&quot;We all jerk off about how smart we are sometimes without there ever really being anything sexy about the idea.&quot;</FONT><BR></FONT></P>\n<P><FONT size=2>Anyway, what I&apos;m getting at is that we were and&nbsp;still are&nbsp;very&nbsp;ignorant.&nbsp; The difference between the me of yesterday and myself of today is that&nbsp;I realize it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could&nbsp;never&nbsp;begin to imagine the scope, but that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t know it&apos;s there.&nbsp; I don&apos;t think there is such a thing as pure ignorance, so it&nbsp;must not be the key to bliss.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even my dog has memory.&nbsp; And I&apos;m&nbsp;assuming that even at the level of retardation described above, one must be as egocentric as an infant, but also must know the displeasure of yearning for the unattainable.&nbsp;Even if those feelings can&apos;t be formulated into a way we can understand.

One month ago I was frying in the desert, worried how the semester would end, wondering how things would get done.  Well everything got done.  Now all I have is work.  I've been kind of looking for a place in Lansing.  Originally the plan was to move down with my friend Trevor and his buddy Tyler.  Tyler was in the coast guard and he got a housing allowance.  So I figured they'd be okay by themselves and began looking for a place with my old roommate, Adam,  from my first year of college at Michigan State.  He's still one of my good friends.  One of those friends that I don't necessarily see all the time, but when we get the chance to hang out, we really just clique.  Well as it turns out, Tyler dropped out on Trevor, so Trevor is sorta up shit creek without a paddle.  I'd like to help him out but he doesn't seem to be showing much initiative to sign up for classes, look for a place to live, etc.  For example, last week I said I'd take him in and get him registered for classes.  We planned for Tuesday to be the day [yesterday], and he'd take the day off work.  Well yesterday morning I get up extra early [for me, about 8am], But when I tried calling, he wasn't answering.  So I go over there and he'd gone to work.  He could have taken the day off because he works for his family.  So basically I took a day off for nothing [and I could really use the money] and scrapped other plans to do this FOR HIM.  He's been nothing but a good friend to me and has helped me out so much and I know we'd be good roomies but I don't like this flaking out shit.

And the steadily deteriorating situation in the Falluja area, a center of anti-American hostility west of Baghdad, has become so precarious that no American or Iraqi forces responded to the attack against the civilians, who worked for a North Carolina company.</p>\n<p>American officials said the civilians were traveling in two sport utility vehicles although some witnesses in Falluja said there were four. &quot;Two got away; two got trapped,&quot; said Muhammad Furhan, a taxi driver.</p>\n<p>It is not clear what the four Americans were doing in Falluja or where they were going. But just as they were passing a strip of stationery stores and kebab shops around 10:30 a.m., masked gunmen jumped into the street and blasted their vehicles with assault rifles. Witnesses said the civilians did not shoot back.</p>\n<p>There are a number of police stations in Falluja and a base of more than 4,000 marines nearby, but even as the security guards were being swarmed and their vehicles set on fire, sending plumes of inky smoke over the closed shops of the city, there were no ambulances, no fire engines and no assistance.</p>\n<p>Instead, Falluja's streets were thick with men and boys and chaos.</p>\n<p>Men with scarves over their faces hurled bricks into the blazing vehicles. A group of boys yanked a smoldering body into the street and ripped it apart. Someone then tied a chunk of flesh to a rock and tossed it over a telephone wire.</p>\n<p>&quot;Viva mujahedeen!&quot; shouted Said Khalaf, a taxi driver. &quot;Long live the resistance!&quot;</p>\n<p>Nearby, a boy no older than 10 ground his heel into a burned head. &quot;Where is Bush?&quot; the boy yelled. &quot;Let him come here and see this!&quot;</p>\n<p>Masked men gathered around him, punching their fists into the air.

And the steadily deteriorating situation in the Falluja area, a center of anti-American hostility west of Baghdad, has become so precarious that no American or Iraqi forces responded to the attack against the civilians, who worked for a North Carolina company. \n\nAmerican officials said the civilians were traveling in two sport utility vehicles although some witnesses in Falluja said there were four. &quot;Two got away; two got trapped,&quot; said Muhammad Furhan, a taxi driver.\n\nIt is not clear what the four Americans were doing in Falluja or where they were going. But just as they were passing a strip of stationery stores and kebab shops around 10:30 a.m., masked gunmen jumped into the street and blasted their vehicles with assault rifles. Witnesses said the civilians did not shoot back.\n\nThere are a number of police stations in Falluja and a base of more than 4,000 marines nearby, but even as the security guards were being swarmed and their vehicles set on fire, sending plumes of inky smoke over the closed shops of the city, there were no ambulances, no fire engines and no assistance. \n\nInstead, Falluja&apos;s streets were thick with men and boys and chaos.\n\nMen with scarves over their faces hurled bricks into the blazing vehicles. A group of boys yanked a smoldering body into the street and ripped it apart. Someone then tied a chunk of flesh to a rock and tossed it over a telephone wire. \n\n&quot;Viva mujahedeen!&quot; shouted Said Khalaf, a taxi driver. &quot;Long live the resistance!&quot; \n\nNearby, a boy no older than 10 ground his heel into a burned head. &quot;Where is Bush?&quot; the boy yelled. &quot;Let him come here and see this!&quot; \n\nMasked men gathered around him, punching their fists into the air. The streets filled with hundreds of people. &quot;Falluja is the graveyard of Americans!&quot; they chanted.\n\nSeveral news crews filmed the mayhem. The images of a frenzied crowd mutilating bodies were reminiscent of the scene from Somalia in 1993, when a mob dragged the body of an American soldier through the streets of Mogadishu. That moment shifted public opinion and eventually led to an American pullout. \n\nThe White House blamed terrorists and remnants of Saddam Hussein&apos;s former government for the attack. &quot;This is a despicable attack,&quot; Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, told reporters, adding that &quot;there are some that are doing everything they can to prevent&quot; a transfer of sovereignty to an Iraqi government on June 30. \n\nAmerican military officials said the violence in Falluja, however chilling, would not scare them away. &quot;The insurgents in Falluja are testing us,&quot; said Capt.

We met up with elizabeth at her place [cool loft, can't believe she's moving out].  Did some bar hopping but didn't find one we'd have liked to stay at so we drove over to good ol' Billy's Lounge, a jazz/blues club we frequent.  Did some drinking.  Did some dancing.  Had a good time.</p>\n<p>Saturday we chilled out at her place while she worked and watched some movies [ie, army of darkness&hellip;] and at about 4 we went and got in line at the church to see Micheal Moore speak.  Of course it was freezing outside and we had to get there about an hour and a half early.  Thank gawd for that though because there were about 3000 people who didn't get in.  Including elizabeth because she got out of work late.  But the speech was totally, completely exhilerating.  I've never felt so in-touch with so many people before&hellip;.ever.  And to top it all off, it was sorta ironic that it was in a church.  He was at the podium where a priest/pastor/whatever would stand.  Everytime he cursed, he'd look up at the painting of jesus and wince&hellip;or make lightning bolt animations/sounds.  The church was beautiful.  Most of the people were pretty cool, too, because a lot of them were Kendall art students.  Though there were people of all demographics there, surprisingly enough.  Grand Rapids is an awesome town.  Despite it's relatively high republican population, it has a pretty big counter culture.  Later that night we went and bought the Dane Cook CD/DVD and laughed half the night away.

				"content_html": "<p>There is a misty rain outside. The first day of this type weather I&rsquo;ve seen since summer decided to exhale it&rsquo;s warm breath upon this lonely peninsula. The trees are motionless but still of a vibrant green, though the grass is patchy and brown in places, only healthy along lines that follow the underground tubes that spider-leg north from the house. The house is empty aside from myself and the dogs that have been anxiously awaiting everyone&rsquo;s return, looking out the window and whimpering at every sound in hopes that the next vehicle is that of their masters'. Everything is quiet now in this cluttered home with the only exception being the fans with their colorless, ominous, soft breathing.</p>\n<p>Summer has almost come to a close; I can feel it. My emotions have painted with all the spectrum but more so with one or two favored colors these three months. Mostly greens and blues and happy colors that are warm and inviting. I&rsquo;m afraid of what the next 6 months will paint. I find myself lingering on that, almost in preparation for the dramatic change that humid-cold/hot summer climates entail. I missed one and a half winters in my journeys along the southern most regions of the country, mostly the gulf coast in naples which at worst got down to a chilly 60 degrees. Though, I might add, that after months and months of 95+ degree weather, 60 does feel rather brisk. Now I drive my winding road at night, to the corner to get cigarettes, with the windows down in my very worn out, humble vehicle. Fifty five degree breezes coming through the trees and off the river have never felt so good. But this is summer. And it&rsquo;s still a 55 degree breeze. A 55 degree breeze that is the &lsquo;low&rsquo; for the day. Soon it will be the &lsquo;high&rsquo; and the low will be well below freezing. The river will freeze, the windows of my little car will ice in the mornings and the blades of grass out front will be frosted well into afternoon until the sun has given all that it can for the two warmest hours of the day and from there, dies, only for the frost to catch up again. I&rsquo;ll see my breath in the air and it will remind me of my childhood when my brothers and I would pretend we were smoking cigarettes. Funny how I do smoke now. I would have never imagined doing it for real.</p>\n<p>And then for the tundra. Mid-December until Early April will be the months I dread the most. The months that make your balls climb close to your body with their scrotum as tight as tanned leather. Shivering uncontrollably with teeth chattering. Inhuman conditions that often pose the question &ldquo;why had our naked-aped ancestors ever considered venturing into such a climate? Especially when there are places like Costa Rica and the northern extremities of the Baja Peninsula.&rdquo; Places where you could where no skins. Places where you could be as naked as the day you were born and never know the discontent of 7ft high drifts of snow.</p>\n<p>Though there are three good things that I can think of off the top of my head that I would consider somewhat positive outcomes to having drastic seasons. 1. Its a good divider of time and it&rsquo;s easier to place time frames in your life when it&rsquo;s separated by seasons. My memories of southern florida all blend into one unified, sweaty memory. 2. It brings people close together because if you&rsquo;re not doing something aerobic outside, it&rsquo;s just too damn cold to be out. Everybody comes indoors to drink, play, have symposiums of sorts&hellip;and try to stay warm with company, cheers and fireplaces. 3. Looking outside after an ice storm and looking at the trees that are encased in glass seems almost too beautiful to be reality.</p>\n<p>So I don&rsquo;t know what this entry is really supposed to be. I guess I&rsquo;m just letting stuff out. I&rsquo;ll close.</p>\n",
